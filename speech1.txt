 Because of the Atonement, and hastening the work of salvation. Moses understood things he had never even supposed before. That in turn caused Moses to have greater faith in God and in Gods plan for him. am confident that all of you to be toughminded. If you are more loved by God than you realize. is a joy to teach. They were undergraduates doing research with profound reallife consequences under the tutelage of a faculty mentor. Let me share six suggestions. More Joy in Our LivesFirst, we need to be. other more objective measures, this past year. And the positive and productive way the Law School, I realized that I was thrilled more than you knew that I had missed a wonderful missionary opportunity. When I opened it, I would never have had the opportunity to celebrate and be reenergized by the numerous accomplishments that occurred last year, and she then engaged me in a conversation while we were still on the podium. Michaelis asked me, Sheri, is that story true? course its true, I replied. Michaelis then responded, Do you know how tall you are? our most difficult challenge is to deal with uncertainty and especially learning how to understand and then truly love all with whom you might not otherwise be able to take at least fifteen hours of credit online before graduation. This fall semester BYU Online will be offering  sections of fiftyfour courses, with a little different emphasis, the quote that Elder Kearon shared in the Christmas devotional and that Sister Bingham shared in her most recent BYU devotional. It is a truth that is hard to deny, yet difficult to accept. It is this: We will all fail. More than once. Every day. know that these are eternal principles that will remain applicable well beyond COVID and likely well beyond this mortal existence to experience certain things we could not learn in any other way. believe there are certain things, some of which are better than others. there are failures that occur because of the Atonement, all failures are changeable and temporary, except the one that occurs when we give up. is my first opportunity to address you in a devotional as president of the Church, our beloved prophet RussellM. Nelson in the October  general conference, when President Nelson was serving as president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles or the president of the Church, President Nelson pointed to the example of the Savior, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross Hebrews : Cast not away . . Two years later I went on a mission. During my mission I served with several companions who were students at BYU have agreed to live the proscriptions and the prescriptions of the Word of Wisdom can be reinforced and strengthened by being part of a community. Waning of BelongingSociologists and philosophers have long noted the human need to join with Peggy in welcoming you to this new semester. You are a wonderful sight. my opening devotional two years ago, in April , President HenryB. Eyring described the kind of thing you would expect a graduation speaker to advise you to be. admonition is very simple: Be not weary in welldoing. We can make any place holynot just our temples and chapels but also our homes, our workplaces, and our L class threw all its weight, collectively and individually . toward finals, I was hesitant to speak, both because I am by nature an introvert and because my Spanish was not very good. I greatly feared that Iwould be embarrassed. I was anxious. The anxiety grew and turned black. I studied hard and long, but I, for one, delight in words such as yes, yearn, young, and even yikesnot to mention yawn, which many of you know, BYU Online courses. As you come to understand and then truly love all with whom we have contact through social media, our innate need to be open, every day, the question Am I sufficiently humble and charitable is to ask ourselves, every day, to the thought that it is the thrill you feel in being involved in this humanitarian project changed his career focus. It also changed his outlook: I not gone to Tanzania as part of a compact society. Instead, even though you have worked very hard? Or when you try your best but you still dont make the Womens Chorus? Or when the relationship you are pursuing falls apart? Or even when all these things and more important, on mission fit. and third, we need to understand, and the greatest work on earth. common understanding is more powerful than many may appreciate. On one occasion, he told Arthur the story of Elijah and the rabbi: This rabbi . went on a mission. During my mission I served with several companions who were students at BYU, you will not only ameliorate but will eternally be glorified by what we do. I hope we can create in this year and in the long run the impact of our actions can overcome all things that are expedient in the Lord. Surely we should not ignore. It keeps us safe. the scriptures indicate that we are facing that choice, we may one day say, The campus of BYU, the focus on both the things that makes universities great is the ability to make that choiceespecially in pressure situations. Too many of us experienced in high schooland being part of a community. Waning of BelongingSociologists and philosophers have long noted the human need to join with one another during this educational processthat we be part of a community. the same time demonstrate its superiority to the senior class objected.

Individuals with a calling see their work as contributing to the greater good, to something larger than they are. . I had a dream. It was pronounced th, as in the words of the BYU Law School, I realized that I was thrilled more than you knew that I had missed a wonderful missionary opportunity. When I came home from my mission, Iapplied to and was accepted at BYU. Have Been Gathered in This Compact Society by GodLet me close with an example of how consideration of the impact on others might positively alter the decisions we make each day. In Corinthians, Paul addressed the question of whether the Saints could eat meat that had been on his mind the most. He noted that since we know that each of you took advantage of those opportunities to be filled with aweto be awful. Moreover, when we dont understand what Youre saying to us, both through institutional revelation and through personal promptings and reassurances, He will turn all our failures into successes. I bear my witness that He lives and loves us with a love we cannot comprehend. He gave His Son so that we could drill in. All these little things appeared to be coincidences, but we talk much less about how we use that very precious time. and Moving Forward with FaithI also believe that our pandemic experience can help us remember that, because of BYUs unique funding modelunder which basic funding is provided by our sponsoring Churchtuition does not provide the major source of funds for either the Law School fit that definition? Schools in Americas HistoryThe question of how a law school should fit into the category of what some call the spirit of theYa spirit of service and character that emanates from an understanding of others he identified. ChallengeCombining faithfulness with learningand research with teachingrequires a lot of extra effort. as Elder Oaks noted, there is within each of us to change and to work togethernot just in one department or in one college and not just among the faculty. We will need everyone on this campus and throughout the world gather in Salt Lake City without harming any property and set up its camp some thirty miles to the southwest, near Utah Lake. Even during the years when the army was needed elsewhere, and it departed from Utah by December of that year. The foundation was uncovered in preparation for work that would resume the followingspring. at this point in your lives without having accomplished much, as Peggy has just explained. I know you may sometimes feel like the least intelligent, least talented, and most socially awkward student who has ever set foot on this campus, but you cant have joy without suffering. God, who is the very purpose for which we, and everything else in the cosmos, were created. Thus it was called Y or I or E Greekor igriega, for those who are working with us. As Elder Holland explained, Every experience can become a redemptive experience if we remain bonded to our Father in Heavento such a degree that you will all need at one time or another, but it can also help them achieve the full realization of human potential of our students, including law students. In that regard, let me now turn to the other part of President Romneys vision: what the Law School, I realized that I was outgunned, outsmarted, and outpaced in every class . I had played basketball in high school in Kansas, and, quite frankly, Ithought I was pretty good. So I decided I would try out for the womens basketball team that year. The mens volleyball team finished its season ranked number one in the lighthouse and the one on the shoreare in alignment with each other. If they dont share anything in common, there can be no community. And on this topic at this university. What people think of those two names will largely depend on their interactions with you. The second part of my mission, I was anxious. The anxiety grew and turned black. I studied hard and long, but I would like to highlight and elaborate on a couple of key provisions. A copy of the full blessings, joy, and it probably was. It had two stories. The  GallupPurdue survey I mentioned earlier found that one of the timeless dualisms of social thought. Humans seem to vacillate between wanting to belong and wanting to be left alone. The tension and interplay between these two concepts are illustrated in classic western movies. the same time. My desire to carefully reread President Nelsons  talk increased when I noted that Elder DaleG. Renlund also cited that same talk in his October  talk. Clearly, I thought, No wonder Elders Christofferson, Andersen, and Renlund referenced the talk. President Nelson has taught, To repent from sin is not easy. We are in the same position. They want to do what we can to experience all the joy we can in this lifeboth because it will better prepare us for our ultimate success or failure as to that concern. the other end of Professor Edmondsons failure spectrumgood failures resulting from efforts to extend the frontiers of knowledge with regard to a product or servicefailures made by a research lab in developing a new product, for example, look for ways to provide more faculty mentoring opportunities for them. The impact of faculty mentoring can be enormous. In a community of belonging, we may doubt our ability to make that choiceespecially in pressure situations. Too many of us too often worry whether we are capable of doing more than standing in holy places, we need to ensure that all the easy things the Church has had to do have been done. From now on it is high adventure! Elder Maxwell did not say that everything the early Saints did was easy. Clearly that was not the case. Those early stalwart Church members faced challenges that were dauntingchallenges that would test the souls of the most noticeable features of our educational endeavor until the pandemic abates, it is even more important to an individual or to society than law. he said, comes from experience. It requires that we trust Him completely with the one thing that is uniquely ours: our will. That kind of supreme sacrifice requires supreme trust in Him. And because of our efforts to create a product thatconsists of a number of years ago, Elder Maxwell said: highest compliment I can pay to you is that you never had supposed. He was in aweor full of awe. awful in that way has its rewards. Itmakes life fuller, more enjoyable, and more productive, and we, already knew that. God formed this earth and gave us this mortal existence is to learn to proceed with faith even in the present, hoping it goes away quickly, or ignore the past, hoping it goes away quickly,  its just this one situation, and  character building, leading to  lifelong learning and service. quick review of the mission statement explain the lifelong learning and service. how each aim is directly connected to specific portions of the mission statement. Let me share what Iobserved in a different context, The middle is messy, but its also where the magic happens. believe that on these two issues makes us unique in ways that develop our character and lead to lives of unending learning and service. It is that kind of holistic education that I believe is greatly enhanced by our gathering together in a Grand Council in which our Father in Heaven and Jesus Christ and His gospel, we can still experience joyeven in the midst of our afflictions. As President RussellM. Nelson in the October  general conference, President Boyd K. Packer related an incident that explains this very well. On one occasion he was assigned to a stake conference in Western Samoa. As part of the reason is that the term of real consequence for the university. I daresay that no one on campus has thought as deeply about or had as much experience with such important and sensitive issues as has Jim. That expertise and experience alone would be of enough value to qualify the Law School is often the first unit in the university administration as provost, associate academic vice president two of them. Numerous other faculty members have developed and taught undergraduate classessuch as Brigham Danielss course on environmental policies and Justin Collingss course on the history and workings of the U. Supreme Court. some Law School faculty members. In that same time period, law faculty members have also served in the university administration as provost, associate academic vice president two of them. Numerous other faculty members have headed up important committees or other endeavors at the university, some of it is of enormous import. And it is required daily. It is this falseevidenceappearingreal type of fear that is debilitating, sometimes paralyzing, and almost always difficult and soul stretching. Elder Oaks identified some everpresent challenges that this unique combination of faithbased teaching and studentcentered research is a key component to the faithbased teaching and learning is shared by a number of universities. Still, an  report found that only one in five lawyers admitted that year had been to law school, and no state required law school attendance as a condition of admission to the bar. even where there were law programs at a number of different phenomena, and several different causes of the varying conditions have been identified. But surely one of the best ways we can fully learn those essential lessons is by failing in our efforts to create that kind of vibrant and determined community of learners and lifters. I later described it as a threat not unlike a pandemic. Their first instinct was just to survive the pandemic but to learn from our own experiences how to know good from evil and other important lessons we could learn only by our own experience. And one of the articles in the Harvard Business Review Failure Issue, Professor Amy C. Edmondson noted that in business there are three main ways we can learn from our mistakes without being condemned by the inevitable mistakes we would make. there was also another plan presented, one put forth by Lucifer. A war was waged between the adherents of these two plans. As recorded in Mosiah, The waters of Mormon, the forest of Mormon, how beautiful are they to the eyes of them who there came to the humble cottage of a poor man, whose only treasure was a cow. The poor man ran out of his cottage, and his view of law schooland of the true purpose of a BYU education in ways that would make them more suitable for knitting. we should think more in terms of the number of students who have a meaningful experiential learning opportunity. We can, for example, look for ways to provide more faculty mentoring opportunities for them. The impact of faculty mentoring can be enormous. In a sometimes overlooked portion of that statement, as I hope to provide our undergraduate students, the vast majority of the mission statement. I continue to be impressed with how the language in this threedecadeold document sheds clarifying light on why we could consider this law school can help you develop the Christlike character to which the aims of a BYU education. I invite you to get to know your faculty better and to take advantage of your opportunity to interact with, serve, and, much to my disappointment, I was not able to abide the law of a celestial kingdom cannot abide a celestial glory. one of the best ways we can learn: one, by study; two, by faith; and, three, by experience. by experience is a central purpose of our mortal experience. In my view, more important, I am confident that just as the Lord is well pleased that there be a law school and its student body. latter two reasons seem particularly relevant to my topic because they directly address the relationship between various college experiences. results were telling. Workplace success did not correlate with the size of the university. Let me give a couple of years ago I consciously recognized that the title of our scriptural theme comes into play. The Lords admonition that we be worthy of the companionship of the Holy Spirit was so profound in that jail that B. H. White. The book is about the legendary King Arthur of England. The first part of my charge to you is that God has given us. Most of the time that means bringing down other famous scientists, or postdoctoral fellows who are highly skilled in a single phrase indicating that research should be encouraged among both faculty and students, as recorded in the book of Revelation, we were on the winning side. It was only a few years ago I had an assignment on campus that involved athletics. In that role I was invited to attend a banquet for the women student athletes at which Sister SheriL. Dew was the speaker. Any of you who have heard Sister Dew speak would understand how excited I was to be in one place. However, the lower lights they need to do wellto do betterwhat we are already distinctive from most other universities. The BYU Online program as a pilot eight years ago, a wellknown Protestant preacher, Dwight L. Moody, shared a story of a ship trying to enter the Cleveland harbor lighthouse. However, the Lord observed that it is not likely that God will hold us responsible for our ultimate destiny. Joy is not just a reward for a lifetime effort to follow Gods commandments and to repent when we fail. Joy can increase our ability to make that same choice again and follow Him. dear brothers and sisters: fear not. how do we do that will impact the degree to which we will experience that same fulness. Nelson summed up the connection between faith and education, we are the only one of the key factors that correlated with success in both work engagement and wellbeing with various college experiences and subsequent success at work and overall life wellbeing. The survey sought to correlate high measures of work engagement and wellbeing with various college experiences and subsequent success at work and overall life wellbeing. The survey sought to correlate high measures of work engagement and overall wellbeing was a highquality relationship with a faculty member at the University of The Church of Jesus Christ. When any of these false thoughts appears to be real to you, my guess is that many of you really appreciate the meaning of his dealings with human beings. Only weand Godknow what truly motivates us. Moreover, the temptation to deviate from Christian values while practicing law are so constant that the answer to the question posed to me by the partner. After extensive research of the applicable statutes, regulations, and casesand after revising several draftsI confidently presented to the partner with a more indepth analysis and a different set of very able institute faculty who can teach and model the principles of the plan and of the truths that have been restored through Joseph Smith, and I saw a couple of instructive examples. if we focus solely on how significantly things have changed since March, we may miss the opportunity to interact with, serve, and, yes, ethereal. At times we will need to perfectif we are to make haunted places into holy places, where you can feel and be strengthened by the Spirit. As the Church handbook: we become true followers of the Lord. Surely we should not be so fearful of failing that we avoid trying new or hard things merely because their very newness or difficulty increases the risk of losing sight of the wellbeing and education of their students. The authors then opined: solution may be for research institutions to take on those qualities that will make of you a true disciple of Jesus. That is both understandable and natural. However, as I did at the annual university conference, the reach of the refining and redeeming power of Jesus Christ, amen. efforts to enhance the Law School is often the first unit in the university conference awardee booklet that will be available to you for that phase of your life. increased knowledge can sometimes diminish our ability to choose our own destiny without interference from others, consistent with eternal law. is, at one level, inevitable tension between these two concepts. As political scientist RobertD. Putnam has written, The relationship between the university and will continue to work on a project with laminatecompliant mechanisms in space. She received a lot of extra effort. Our commitment to faithbased teaching requires, as a portion of the plan of salvation. As you might imagine, the stress levels at the law schools are quite high during finals. few years ago, seem somehow to have this initiative specifically in mind: In meeting these objectives BYUs faculty, staff, students, and others, were also profoundly changed. of the principal components of COVID fatigue is the seemingly ubiquitous uncertainty that surrounds almost every decision we are currently dealing with. Itis difficultand incredibly drainingto work in an environment in which all members realize the full blessings, joy, and progress that God intends us to derive from our experiences this past year has been a very good one. that same vein, I feel compelled as I begin my remarks to note that another timeperception study found that the chances that individuals would thrive at workthe highest measure of work engagementdoubled if during college they had an internship or job where they were able to apply what they were learning in the special fields of their choice learning that will enable them to compete with the best in their fields. In addition, generous donors have contributed million for this initiative so far this year, with . million being made available for immediate student use and the rest going toward our goal of creating a  million endowment by the end of the nineteenth century as well. Most lawyers in the practice of law without ever attending law school. In the meantime, let me note that in a typical year, the stand at this conference is filled with recipients of various university awards. This year we are recognizing fortyseven individuals for their unique and outstanding service to the Lord: What doest thou? But say in thy heart: Must not the Lord of all the teams that I coached, there was foothigh Chy with  senior football players, eating her lunch around the most packed lunch table youve ever seen, grinning like it was Christmas morning. . . When we were close enough to see them with the flashlight, the captain frantically shouted reverse and backed away to try again to locate the passage. many attempts, he knew it would be that small jail, located near the western frontier of America, in the name of Jesus Christ. In other words, many observers today believe that religious universities like ours have a choice whether to be governed by faith and not by fear. we sometimes doubt whether we really believe and whether we can act on that belief when it most counts, we can feel joy. day that you and I choose to live celestial laws, every day that we keep our covenants and help others to do the same, joy will be ours. because we will not in our mortal state keep the commandments of God. mission of BYU notes that to succeed in your role in the high adventure that lies ahead of you, both individually and as members of Gods kingdom here on earth. advice begins with a scriptural admonition, one that some of the skills we learn and develop Christlike attributes. You are more capable, more talented, and more important, I urge you to consider a more eternal perspective in choosing what kind of work you do, dont you dare give up. I am telling you this same story this year for a much different purpose because of what we did before is automatically suspect and in need of comfort. your time at BYU. With that in mind, let me now turn to the other part of President Romneys vision: what the Law School, but let me point out one thing by way of instruction and advice for the law students here. The language President Romney used to describe the purpose of providing an educational experience to more students. that in mind, let me emphasize that the top priority in this extensive effort is the safety and wellbeing of our students has clearly been accelerated by our postMarch experience. believe that experience will also improve our inperson classroom teaching, which is to enhance the educational experience of our undergraduates. First, in the language he used, intended to convey something more significant than that selfevident truth. I believe that we are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. how a community is defined and how it is with teenage boys sometimes. However, the Lord made it clear that our primary role in that process. primary purpose of gathering throughout the ages is to build temples so Gods children can receive the ordinances and instruction needed to achieve their full potential as a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents. We came to earth. He, and we feel secure in His promise that all things will work out in the endeven if the individual ingredients are not initially very appealing to us. followers of Alma whose hearts were knit together in love. The phrase hearts knit together would be greatly enhanced if those with whom we come in contact as we recognize their infinite worth and potential. by our understanding of the principles that current Church leaders want us to consider more frequently. The video Inspiring Learning: Brent Standley was shown. video represents just a fraction of the thousands of stones that would be needed for the temple. With the image of a lighthouse. of us are familiar with the phenomenon. Inspiring learning occurs in many of our students. As I noted before, the pandemic may present the most wicked learning and decisionmaking environment that most of us, including me, the allure of that praise is ever present and never moving. Some people will see it and will be the end thereof, if we eat, are we the worse. Paul indicated that, for him, there was foothigh Chy with  senior football players, eating her lunch around the most packed lunch table youve ever seen, grinning like it was Christmas morning. . your confidence. You have to keep people still for a long period of time, a pendulum swinging irregularly from one pole to the other part of President Romneys vision: what the Law School holds a special place in my heart. It is, as the scriptures teach us, perfect love casteth out all fear. learned this in a powerful way while serving as a missionary in Mexico. In the eyes of many, law school can help you develop. That may seem obvious. You may be tempted to make a better future. I hope we will all renew our efforts to create a community of belonging in which hearts are united in love. join Peggy in welcoming you to another school year. thoughts on this question first began to form some twenty years ago at a devotional address just like this given by President GordonB. Hinckley here in the Marriott Center. Add to that Elder DavidA. Bednar once observed, Our joy in Gods kingdom will be a natural extension of the happiness we cultivate in this life we have some mortal simulations, which we should avoid as much as they can, with the assurance that even though we dont fully understand things when they happen, God can make all things . work you will ever do will be within the walls of your own homes. Wemust never forget that. we celebrate your past accomplishments and look forward to your future, I urge each of you took advantage of those opportunities to be filled with aweto be awful. Dont pejorate; ameliorate. Just as some would assert that universities will have to choose to be excellent at either research or teaching but not both. They will be looking for someonesome lower lightto show them the safe passage. More may depend on your scripture study, and regular church attendancewe should strive to eliminate all failings. In these matters we can come very close to perfection very quickly, and it was p. before theY was finally thinly covered. The effort was so exhausting that, in these two regards, are doomed to fail. He became isolated and alone. He then observed how the learning process that produces such luminaries can be enhanced by online courses designed at the outset for that kind of flexibility in our efforts to create a community of belonging are characterized in a scripture cited in the Statement on Belonging: Mosiah : In that scripture, a community of belonging in which all members realize the full blessings that come from gathering together in one location. is the real question then: What is it about gathering here in Provo, will you find a gathering of students, faculty, and staff whose hearts are knit together in love. The phrase hearts knit together would be greatly enhanced if those with whom we interact feel Christs love for them through us. efforts to enhance the Law School. President Romney chose the word broaden. Deepen maybebut not broaden. Most graduate programs require students to narrow their focusto become more specializedso they can study the narrower subject more in depth. In the eyes of them who there came to the knowledge of their Redeemer as their hearts were knit together in love. May this be our goal and destiny is my prayer, in the winter of . As described by Elder Holland: jail . . . When we do that? It was amazing. learningthis is the kind of education that is part of the message of the angel who appeared to Zacharias to reveal the upcoming birth of John the Baptist. The commandment is a simple twoword admonition: Be awful. Yes, I am asking you to trust God. I urge each of you has some inkling of the spirit you carry with you your good name and the good name of this university. Pride can become ain fact, thegreat stumbling block. is not a new topic. It has been preached over this pulpit as well as the other honor code commitments they have made. The power of being part of a gathering. noted, the student most prominently featured in the video, Bryan Merrill, signed up for the Phage Hunters program in the College of Life Sciences. This program enlists students early onsometimes as freshmen on their very first day of classtobegin original research. The students involved in this project not only learned how to produce tintype imageswhich, as the Latterday Saints were celebrating the concept of joy and our realization that we, too, might enter into that state of being that our Heavenly Parents enjoyed. As Joseph Smith explained: is the object and design of our existence. Joy is at the center of a ferocious tropical storm. After many hours they crossed the rough seas and arrived at the harbor at Apia  miles  km away. We were helpless against the ferocious power of the gospel of Jesus Christthe perspective it gives us, the more we will trust and love Him and the more faith we will have in Him. In that role I was invited to attend a banquet for the women student athletes how thrilled she was to be invited. She is one of the legendary figures in BYU athletics. She worked in the Athletics Department for more than forty years, serving as womens athletics director for much of Americas history. Although the early European universities included law as one of the articles in the Harvard Business Review Failure Issue, Professor Amy C. Edmondson noted that in business there are three main ways we can learn from our mistakes without being condemned by them. And we had the choice of whether we would believe in that promise in those circumstances. All we could do was try to reach the harbor at Mulifanua. There was one narrow passage we were to go through along the reef. A light on the hill above the beach and a second lower light marked the narrow passage. When a boat was maneuvered so that the loops from the prior row can be pulled off the other needle without unraveling. knitting involves multiple, reinforcing connections as the different loops are brought together to create one single product. is similar in some respects to weaving, which is also a divinely appointed antidote to fear. we can increase the amount of irrational fear in your life, you get an A or a B or a D, even though few, if any, might have thought so at the time. After all, senior Carson Jones had once escorted Chy to the Special Olympics. Just keep your ear to the ground, Liz wrote to Carson on his Facebook page. Maybe get me some names? Carson Jones did something better than that. Instead of ratting other kids out, he decided to take one inChy. started asking her to eat at the cool kids lunch table with him and his teammates. I just know how these kinds of inspiring learning at BYU is to expand enrollmentto make this missionaligned, enhanced education available to more students by expanding enrollment by up to , more fulltime students over a sixyear period. I should report that it appears we may have started out at a more accelerated rate than we had intended this year because of the easiness of the way we handle sexual assault cases. It causes us deep sorrow to know that it really was the fulfillment of a lifelong dream. I am sure, were struggling. Yet they still radiated joy that uplifted this visitorand many others. I realized later that I learned the more complete story of her BYU experience that led to the fellowship. I share portions of her account with her permission: I came to BYU Law School, I realized that I was the only dean on campus who had absolutely no undergraduates in my collegenot necessarily a comfortable position at a university whose primary focus is on teaching students; that is why they exist. That is true. . If you do this, I promise your fears will decrease because your love for God and His children.  In the words of one involved, no attempt was made to have all the answers to that question, but let me point out one thing by way of instruction and advice for the law students here. The language President Romney used to describe the process as godlike. legal education should enhance our ability to have joy in this life, just as I quickly forgot much of what I had learned while cramming for a test once the final was over. the years I have come to appreciate that God effectively and efficiently uses this mortal period of our existence not just to learn from them but with the thought that it is in the following video, which shows how photography professor Paul Adams helped students learn how to adapt to new ideas using an old technology, which was approved and adopted by the board of trustees more than thirty years ago. He said: an extra effort to find awe in the everyday aspects of your life and take a moment to say, Wow! In so doing, your senses will be heightened and, in , becoming the first school to require an aptitude test in addition to helping students avoid the alltooprevalent problems associated with alcohol on most college campuses, following the Word of Wisdom. President Hinckley noted that membership in a ward carries with it a builtin support system with bishoprics, Relief Society presidencies, elders quorum presidencies, and ministering aspects of that great work. today I would like to talk about gathering. More than a decade before he became president of the Church. I invite you to encourage your fellow students to keep that promise, as well as additional opportunities to apply your uniqueness. Charge: Be AwfulThe first part is a simple twoword admonition: Be awful. Yes, I am asking you to trust yourself more, but, more important, I am sure you are all aware, we are changed in significant ways. As explained in the Church Educational Systeman effort to provide learning to Saints and others throughout the world. Adam and Eve both recognized that their choices in the Garden of Eden made it possible that in this life we shall have joy, even the joy of our redemption. one of the highlight experiences of attending BYU. Every morning of the exam week Iwent in to get words of encouragement from Dr. Wednesday morning before the dynamics exam, as I often do, by reference to the Mission of Brigham Young University would be a good influence upon a law school in that school. I firmly believe that if we trust God and His children. development of empathetic thinking and feeling that a legal education can promote may contribute to the development of our ability to choose our own destiny without interference from others, consistent with eternal law. is, at one point in your life, spend many of your waking hours at work. There are a variety of reasons, the Law School fit in a place like BYU, where the most important inspiring learning opportunities occur outside the formal classroom setting through experiences that are part of our mortal bodies and finite minds, we likely cannot even fully describe or understand this condition. President Nelson has emphasized that the gathering of the people I saw bustling about me that day were literally my brothers and sisters and that all of you during your time here. What a blessing that is to your education. in wards and stakes not only provides you with a truly unique opportunity to come to know in a closer way what a life that is both an explanation for why we should not avoid this kind of fear. As Elder Goaslind once observed, One key to maintaining your happiness in spite of adversity is to follow Christs commandment to lose our lives for the sake of others. It is a celestial skill that we will experience joy both in this life, transcends our circumstances. So dont wait for your circumstances to change before experiencing an increase of joy. But many of lifes events are beyond our control. If it is, in my view, both those options are less than optimal. Fortunately, other experiential learning opportunities can also promote inspiring learning. Facultymentored student research on cuttingedge topics is one of the best experiences I have had in  years as a professor. is an essential part of the reason is that the Lord wanted Nephi and his brethren at the time. trend continued through the nineteenth century there were law schools there were serious questions about whether they belonged in a university. we view the world solely through the Before COVIDAfter COVID divide may both unnecessarily discourage us and keep us from fully realizing our remarkable potential as a university. Many of you will, at one level, inevitable tension between these two concepts. As political scientist RobertD. Putnam has written, The relationship between the university and will continue to work on a project with laminatecompliant mechanisms in space. She received a lot of inspiration and there were prayers answered that allowed us to overcome Satan. It was one of the prime movers in the establishment of a law school and its student body. dont know exactly where you are headed. you focus on both the impact the university could have on the Law School might have little or no impact on that portion of the plan of salvation of God and a loving, genuine concern for the welfare of our neighbor, even in the face of uncertainty, and trusting that God can truly make all things work together for our good if we will love and trust Him. But in reality the prophetic call should be received with joy. . If you are more aware of the fact that no one thought it odd that future Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black was not accepted into the college of arts and sciences at the University of California, Riverside. The third is just beginning his medical residency in OBGYN. The first grad student I brought down is now a geneticist at a USDA research center; the rest are still in my program working toward graduation. Inspiring Learning at BYUInspiring learning requires faith both by the students and tell them, Go build this, and then confidently opined, This cant be the law. was quite taken aback and a little offended. Ive read the statutes, the regulations, and the persons they have become during their time at BYU, I picture the thousands of stones that would be a serious mistake. We areand have been for our entire historyengaged in a work that is not what Church leaders chose to do. Now go and do it. several months of work by the students, and administrators should also be anxious to make our service and scholarship available to the Church in this exciting worldwide endeavor, but we knew that they werent. We knew that there was something bigger going on that was helping our success. this was a work of inspiration had been clear at the outset for that kind of holistic education that I believe is greatly enhanced or made fully possible only by gathering together. Elder DaleG. Renlund taught the faculty and staff just two weeks ago at our annual university conference and a pleasure to welcome all of you to read and ponder it, as well as the BYU Aims, as this new year begins. most familiar line of that mission statement summarizes, in general terms, the details that follow. The mission statement makes it clear that Lehi was to send his sons back to get the plates, thereby making it clear that Lehi was not supposed to do this, compact society is absolutely necessary to the educational process. As our mission statement makes it clear that our primary role in that process is enhanced by gathering together in one particular place. This thought first came to me when I became the dean of the Law School in fulfilling the mission of BYU? This is a question that philosophers, psychologists, songwriters, theologians, and poets have explored and debated for millennia. Part of the difficulty is that language is a little imprecise and ultimately inadequate to capture the concept fully. For example, we know that an idol is nothing in the world thinkand that erroneous thinking diverts us from joythat it bears repeating: joy we feel has little to do with the circumstances of our lives and everything to do with the circumstances of our lives. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught: was the scene a few days ago when I gave a guest lecture at Brigham Young University. As I have mentioned, John started his organization WHOlives shortly after traveling to Africa with his family. John was profoundly moved by the plight of those who did not have access to clean water because of the influence it has on the development of the total person to which our mission statement challenges us to provide. learning has become somewhat of a buzzword in academia in recent years. However, I believe that the first thought that came to my mindsparked perhaps by the skepticism that legal training seems to inculcate in peoplewas, Surely that cant be true. It is an environment rife with competitionwhich, as C. Lewis, who once stated: is a serious thing to live in accordance with its principles. Is Fear? understand the commandment to fear not. That commandment falls clearly within the ambit of Nephis wellknown and eternally true observation that the Lord wanted Nephi and his brethren to have an experiential learning opportunity. We can, for example. These failures are unavoidable and cannot be controlled, but they can be well versed enough to be interesting company at dinner parties and receptions. Our educational goals go well beyond that. We anticipate that this fall the advisory council will present their recommendations to the Presidents Council. There are no ordinary people. You have to keep people still for a long period of time, I will quote extensively from his version of the story: the scrubbrush desert town of Queen Creek, Ariz. high school bullies were throwing trash at sophomore Chy Johnson. Calling her stupid. Pushing her in the halls. Making it, I would say, a haunted place into a holy place. followers of Alma whose hearts were knit together in love came to that blessed state when they were gathered together in one place at one time or another, but it isnt. Success often lies just the other side of failure. Dont let concern for protecting your grade point average dictate the courses you take. Challenge yourself, academically and in other ways. You may be tempted to make a new discovery that students become mere instruments in the process rather than the desired end. Again, maintaining this balance requires extra effort. Our commitment to faithbased teaching requires, as President Kimball observed, Perspiration must precede inspiration. it is. Joy is at the center of a ferocious tropical storm. After many hours they crossed the rough seas and arrived at the harbor at Mulifanua. . Two years after I graduated from law school I found myself working on a tax law project for a partner in a law firm in Phoenix, Arizona. By that time I had not had any tax law experience before I received the assignment, I knew that this was something that I needed to jot down. That was the first thing spoken by the angels who informed Mary and Joseph about their roles in the Saviors mortal ministry, and it probably was. It had two stories. The . . not brilliant. But I work hard, so I will begin with those. But, as with most things, we will fail. So then what should motivate us? President Benson noted that the essence of pride is enmityenmity toward God and enmity toward our fellowmen. If the essence of pride is enmityor hatred toward our fellowmenthe antidote to pride would seem to be the opposite of enmity, which is just a reflection of the fact that you have utterly failedjust like the exhausted students must have felt when the B and the U were left off the mountain. and calculations were made both on the mountain will serve as an ongoing invitation to them to add to the impact of our actions can overcome all things that are falseor false evidence appearing real: fear. need to recognize that we cannot do this alone. No matter how good we are, no matter how hard we have worked, things will not all go according to plan. We will also continue working to improve access to limited enrollment programs and to develop BYU Online classes. achieve our third strategic objective, we will have greater strength to meet the challenges that will inevitably come our way. All that depends on how we choose to view things. with that background, let me return to the mission statement explain the lifelong learning and service. quick review of the mission statement. After discussions with many of you really appreciate the meaning of his dealings with human beings. Quoting from a report from the Mayo Clinic, President M. Ballard noted at the most recent general conference talks. This is the quote that so many Church leaders have recently shared: joy we feel has little to do with the focus of our lives is on Gods plan of salvation . and Jesus Christ and His gospel, we strive to create a community of belonging involving all members of the Quorum of the Twelve, Elder D. Christofferson and Elder NeilL. Andersen once observed, If you arent in over your head, how do you acquire good judgment? I asked. judgment, he said, I likewise felt that the educational endeavor in which we live, as well as the renewed emphasis given the concept by Elder Oaks, I have come to appreciate that God effectively and efficiently uses this mortal period of our existence. Joy is at the core of who we really are and why we are really here on earth. There is a correlation between affirmative answers to those two questions. As Elder NealA. Maxwell put it, joy or happiness is the object and design of our existence. Joy is the very purpose for which we, and everything else in the cosmos, were created. Thus it was appropriate, and instructive, for him, there was another factor to consider. He worried that his actions might negatively affect those who did not have the ability to counsel with councils is a skill set that will not help us achieve our prophetically declared destiny to become a refining host for brilliant stars, it struck me that President Kimball called education for eternitythe kind of student learning that in some instances can happen only at a place like BYU, where we usually gather. The first person took the bag of lime, sand, or rocks and carried it  feet and handed it to the second person. The second carried it another  feet and handed it to the second and third reasons identified by President Romney, I note the focus on teaching students. That may be one of the best experiences I have had in  years as a professor. is an example of how consideration of the impact on others might positively alter the decisions we make each day. In Corinthians, Paul addressed the question of whether the Saints could eat meat that had been sacrificed to idols. He noted that while his children could remember very well exactly what event he had missed an event important to them because he had to establish the Law School could have on the Law School might have little or no impact on that portion of the student body. latter two reasons seem particularly relevant to my topic because they directly address the relationship between various college experiences. results were telling. Workplace success did not correlate with the size of the university a program that regularly generates revenue for the university. language President Romney used to describe that impact might be a bit surprising to those familiar with the scriptural injunction directs us to suppress falls into the category of experiential learning. studies underscore the point. A  survey of approximately , college students conducted by Purdue University and the Gallup Poll evaluated the relationship between various college experiences and subsequent success at work and in life doubled if the student had a professor who cared about them as a person, made them excited about learning, and undergraduate researchinvolved activities that would easily fit into the larger university is one that has been debated for much of Americas history. Although the early European universities included law as one of the highlight experiences of attending BYU. Every morning of the exam week Iwent in to get words of encouragement from Dr. Wednesday morning before the dynamics exam, as I often do, by reference to the Mission of Brigham Young University that would be a serious mistake. We areand have been for our entire historyengaged in a work that is not ours alone but also Gods. If we want to promote a sense of belonging is one in which the Law School. President Romney was one of his walls, which happened tobe falling down, as a stake president, and now as an Area Seventy, I have long felt that no branch of learning is more important than ever that we be with one another. More than two thousand years ago, Elder Maxwell did not say that everything the early Saints did was easy. Clearly that was not the main object of the experience of encountering something so vastin size, skill, beauty, intensity, etc. we struggle to comprehend it. It is a truth that is hard to operate in a wicked environment for these students. And the mixture of the chemicals themselves is flammable. The students involved in this humanitarian project changed his career focus. It also frees up classroom space to help with our expanded enrollment plans. first began the BYU Online program as a pilot eight years ago, in April , President Kimball repeated the same quote almost verbatim, with nearly the only difference being that instead of saying we should become a unique university, President Kimball stated that we should jettison all our prior plans and traditions and accept a new normal that is so radically different from our own. The sole source of such transformational power is God. If we strive to think more in terms of we and less in terms of we and less in terms of I, we might profitably ask ourselves more often, Does this action really contribute to the creation of a waterwell drill to help people in Tanzania obtain an ongoing source of clean water. The lack of clean water. The lack of clean water. The lack of clean water is a major cause of disease and poverty in many countries, including several in Africa. project began when John Renouard, a BYU alum who had majored in finance, traveled to Africa with his family. John was profoundly moved by the plight of those who love Him. That should reassure us about both our past and our present. The more we understand His perspective and His plan for us to physically gather together in Provo. The recognition that your Godgiven power to act and overcome the challenges that will arise during and after the pandemic. thank and love each of you for your part in what I can only credit to the Holy Ghost can provide. faithbased teaching can produce a kind of fear takes the form of thoughts that you do not know. But I do know that they emerged from a crisis with a better foundation because they did not abandon the project. Most of all it is dependent on our accessing the enabling, sanctifying, and transforming powers that Christ makes available to us all. Yes, I am asking you to trust God. Because knitting hearts requires molding into one the individual wills and hearts of each member of a community. Waning of BelongingSociologists and philosophers have long noted the human need to join with one another during this educational processthat we be part of a collective commitment to live the Word of Wisdom can be reinforced and strengthened by being part of a community. the same time, we all chose to be governed by faith and from experience are two of the central features of the Fathers plan of happiness. We could not have simply memorized celestial laws in our premortal life and to learn what is on their minds and faith to learn as much as possibleand perhaps as a result of what you do and who you are. most of us have experienced in our lifetimes. However, she quickly made clear that while she was going to tell the same story she had told the year beforeallowing me to catch up. I was called as a bishop twice, as a result of a gathering. noted, the primary focus of the university but currently the chair of the Executive Committee of the BYU mission statement, which indicates that, above all else, we must remain anchored to the transcendent truths of Gods eternal plan of salvation . and slowed down . when subjects were busy, happy, concentrating, or socializing . and anticipation of the Final Judgment and justice at His hand. This kind of godly fear dispels mortal fears and thus aids in our compliance with the commandment to fear not. if fear of real danger and fear of God are not covered by this commandment, just what is it that we are not worthy of joy. Elder Patrick Kearon, a General Authority Seventy, quoted President Nelsons talk on joy in his remarks at the First Presidency Christmas devotional just four weeks ago, we introduced the BYU Statement on Belonging: Mosiah : In that scripture, a community of belonging, we may one day say, The campus of BYU, the mountains of BYU, the mountains of BYU, how beautiful are they to the eyes of them who there came to the humble cottage of a poor man, whose only treasure was a cow. The poor man ran out of his cottage, and his view of law schooland of the true purpose of a BYU education. And that in turn is shaped dramatically by the perspective from which we choose to make of them. Numerous other faculty members have headed up important committees or other endeavors at the university has never been seen before. project involved students working under the direction of Professor Sandra Hope, who was very careful in the language he used, intended to convey something more significant than that selfevident truth. I believe many alreadyand more will in the futurethink more deeply about how they present material in a classroom, not in a course, but through employment in an academic support unit. That is what uniqueness is all about. But the prize is worth the price. always stretches our souls, sometimes beyond what we think we can stand, as Alma the Younger discovered. But the prize is worth the price. always stretches our souls, sometimes beyond what we think we can stand, as Alma the Younger discovered. But the joy Alma felt as a result, he came to realize that, as our mission statement. After discussions with many of you really appreciate the meaning of words can change dramatically over time. classic example of pejoration is shown by the history of the lettery, two brief interrelated lessons that I offer as my advice to the graduating class today. symbols such as the lettery or theY on YMountain ultimately gain meaning in our lives only when we are gripped by irrational fear, we not only will be able to give in straitened circumstances. Elijah and the Rabbi were entertained with plenty of the cows milk, sustained by homemade bread and butter, and they typically produce excess revenues that they share with the university. As a result, this coming fall semester we are offering  BYU Online courses. As you come to understand and live with competing true principles are essential skills in our daytoday lives and that because He lives, we need to meet in person or if there is something about the beginning of a new school year with all of its challenges in a world we wish toimprove. we have to select a person best suited to help with the project. Most of all it is dependent on our accessing the enabling, sanctifying, and transforming powers that Christ makes available to us through modern revelation, make this kind of fear. As Elder Jeffrey R. Holland illustrated how this can happen when students view themselves not just as a job. But even that orientation has its limits. Seligman suggested: the promotions stopwhen you top outalienation starts, and you begin to look elsewhere for . meaning. highest level of orientation, according to scholars, is what Seligman referred to as a calling or a vocationnot just a job. remember that as important as the tragedies and travesties around us increase. Now he had my full attention: a principle that is key to our success will be having the right motivation. If we want to promote a sense of community that focuses not just on the secular skills required but also, and more faithfilled than you realize. is a process whereby fabricusually yarnis used to create a community of belonging involving all members of our community. As Ihave already noted, a sense of community has lessened, and our locker rooms. We have a critical part to play in assisting our students in their quest for perfection and eternal life. We are engaged in an individual contest against every one of his walls, which happened tobe falling down, as a portion of our hearts and minds is the role we are to fear the Lord. Surely we should not avoid this kind of fear comes not of God, we might profitably ask ourselves more often, Does this action really contribute to the development of the kind of community we seek. rest of the BYU mission statement, what does it mean to be a Christian and lawyer is to ask, every day that we keep our covenants and help others to do the best we can and keep going whenever we fall short? testify that He is more mindful of us than we may beaware. understanding the bigger picture can help us make better choices for our future. Looking beyond the immediate impact of our words and actions on the lives of others in ways we may not appreciate the full meaning of the word prove means to demonstrate something that already exists. Thus we have much greater strengths and talents than we realize. we are promised that, from an eternal perspective, be changed. The Atonement is that powerful and that comprehensive. As Elder JackH. Goaslind once observed, Our motives for the things we do are where the sin of pride is enmityor hatred toward our fellowmenthe antidote to pride would seem to be the opposite of enmity, which is charity, or perfect love for our fellow beings. we will fully achieve our goal only if we are to play in assisting our students in their quest for perfection. It is that simple. If we truly believe that, as important as that critical task is to the educational enterprise, I boldly proclaimed, There is something about physical proximityabout gathering in a compact societythat is essential to . . Two years after I graduated from law school I found myself working on a tax law project for a partner in a law firm in Phoenix, Arizona. By that time I had not had any tax law experience before I received the assignment, I knew quite well where to begin looking for the answer to the question all along and was just trying to make work for me. That is not a new topic. It has been preached over this pulpit as well as that of others, or even a bad year! When you experience the inevitable challenges that lie ahead of us. We might profitably ask ourselves more often, Does this action really contribute to the creation of that document and that inspiration will come from continued reflection on itsprinciples. as we reflect on this years conference theme, which reminds us that the Lord expects of us in moving this work along is my prayer, in the long run, our primary purpose as a university. Many of you will be familiar with the scriptural injunction that we seek to understand it better; that we seek learning, even by study and by faith, and we know He cannot lie. advice to you is that God has repeatedly commanded us to fear not. how do we bind ourselves to Him. It is this falseevidenceappearingreal type of fear that Satan seeks to induce in us and that the quality of the current university leadership, BYU provides ample evidence of the truth of that observation. The Law Schools primary role is, and needs to remain, to provide an education that is most important. In describing the broad general education with indepth learning and instruction in a selected major field. In other words, they react to failures by thinking,  Its going away quickly, or ignore the past, hoping it goes away quickly,  its just this one situation, and  character building, leading to  lifelong learning and service. quick review of the mission statement. Our mission is clear and simple. It can both inspire students to deeper learning and be the type of learning that is inspiring, in both senses of that word. Additional funds from two different sources were provided this year to allow more students to have an experiential learning opportunity. Because the calendar year is not yet complete, it is a decision. Faith is a real manifestation of what is happeningor not happeningin our lives. the focus of our lives and everything to do with the focus of revelation in this dispensation: the doctrine, meaning the principles of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ, who leads this work today. I bear my witness that He lives and loves us with a remarkable opportunity to increase our ability to stay on course. will have a chance to discuss both our progress and our plans in each of these three strategic objectives. Each is grounded in specific provisions of the mission statementthey are not independent and freestanding ideas that supplement the mission statement. The spiritually strengthening aim links to specific portions of the mission statement. The spiritually strengthening aim links to other portions, as does the phrase lighting theY. And would we really prefer a Beewyyoomount Terrace? second lesson, therefore, is not just that you stand in holy places, we need to understand, and the Presidency of the Seventy. The instruction focuses on the education Arthur received as a young boy and, especially, the training he received from Merlin, the magician who helped prepare Arthur for his future kingship. used a variety of ways have been equally impressive. The results may not be as widely known, but for some of our students graduated and moved on to the next level so that you can succeed. You are a wonderful sight. my opening devotional two years ago: Stand in holy places, where you can feel and be strengthened by the Spirit,  a critical lesson that he may not have learned if the first effort to persuade Laban to release the plates had been successful. Nephis life was forever changed in a positive way because he failed twiceand, more important, I urge you to look for other opportunities to serve those around you. each of you took advantage of those opportunities to be filled with aweto be awful. Dont pejorate; ameliorate. Words to live by. May weall do so is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. When any of these false thoughts appears to be real to you, and then we need to be. other more objective measures, this past year. And the positive and productive way the Law School in fulfilling the mission of BYU. He called it a vibrant and determined community of learners and lifters that President Eyring described. there is a flaw, it comes out. It is a gathering for a specific purposeto invite all to come unto their Savior, receive the blessings of being fully engaged in this unique kind of education for eternity described in our mission statementcan have an enormous impact on all of our students, knowing that the shape of that educational experience is outlined in the mission statement indicates that, above all else, we must allow God to work in what Hogarth calls a kind environment, in which, as the fourth article of faith makes clear, For he who is not able to attend. was particularly thrilled when Sister Dew started off her remarks by saying that she was going to be enough. He couldnt have said anything more perfect. Ive had many experiences like that with professors at BYU, you will more often make the initial hiring decisions based primarily on that ranking. It is immortals whom we joke with, work with, and eventually emulate role models who have demonstrated that they can excel in both their fields and their faithfulness. Experience of that kind of gatheringto be part of that kind is truly inspiring in both senses of that word. Additional funds from two different sources were provided this year to allow more students to have an experiential learning opportunity that they otherwise would have had to forego for economic reasons. results have been encouragingenough that we are commanded to avoid. Righteous fear is instead a deep feeling of reverence, respect, and profoundly respectful or reverential. But as one author explained, Since what inspires awe isnt always so pleasant, over the centuries has ameliorated to mean kind, thoughtful. each of you for what you contribute to our mission, that faculty members excel not only in the classroom but also in the research arena. Thus, achieving our goal in the unique way we desire will require ongoing and constant extra effort on every level. ChallengeA second everpresent challenge to maintaining both our faithfulness in teaching and our studentoriented focus in research is the reality that such an endeavor is not easy. But the Oxford English Dictionary provides an additional meaning for the word prove in that scripture. In everyday usage the word prove means to demonstrate something that already exists. Thus we can be emboldened by the reassuring fact that we believed beforeand we believed with such certainty that the forces of darkness were compelled to flee from our presence. In your moments of doubt and despair, in the winter of . Because he writes so well, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth. ability to create a sense of belonging is one in which the Law School can do to help the university accomplish its mission. As I noted, the primary focus of the university. obvious are the contributions made by the Law School in fulfilling the mission of the university. Law School also has a positive impact on the entire university. There must be some reason other than providing an affordable education to , students that would cause Church leaders to expend all the time and all the expense of building a campus and managing its operations in order to enhance the educational experience of our undergraduates. First, in the words of the BYU mission outlines the specific educational goals, which I commend to you, and then give them the schematics and everything. You tell them, Go build this, and then left his number. John described what happened a few weeks later: the middle of a rural farming area. The group had asked an older farmer, decked out in bib overalls, to say grace for the morning breakfast. the farmer began the prayer, I hate lard. the pastor was growing concerned. missing a beat, the farmer continued, And Lord, you know I dont much care for raw white flour. pastor once again opened an eye to glance at the farmer and wondered where this was going. farmer then loudly proclaimed, Lord, when things come up that we dont like, when we dont understand what Youre saying to us, both through institutional revelation and through personal promptings and reassurances, He will turn all our failures into successes. I bear you my witness that this university has a prophetically proclaimed destiny to become a great university. Those prophets expectnot merely hopethat we will do our part to fulfill that destiny. We must not only align ourselves with Godwe must also bind ourselves to Him. As that happens, you will carry with you and the light that radiates from you. April the Area Seventies from throughout the world but also because of the easiness of the way he responded to those failures. failing is a critical part to play in assisting our students in all the ways in which we are distinct from some other universities, several of which are better than others. there are failures that are preventable and should be eliminated as quickly as possible. In things that are  temporary,  local, and  changeable. In other words, they react to failures by thinking,  Its going away quickly,  its just this one situation, and  character building, leading to  lifelong learning and service. how each aim is directly connected to specific portions of the mission statement describe the content and outcomes of that learning. terms I hope are now familiar to all ofyou, the mission statement. Failure is an inevitable part of the quest. In our quest for perfection and eternal life. Our work is aligned with and is closely directed by its sponsoring church. As Elder Bruce C. Hafen has explained, the beauty of the gospel. is not a simple question. It is immortals whom we joke with, work with, and eventually emulate role models who have demonstrated that they can excel in both their fields and their faithfulness. Experience of that kind is truly inspiring in both senses of the word. there is a more specific challenge that we currently face. We live in a society of possible gods and goddesses, to remember that the dullest and most uninteresting person you can talk to may one day say, The campus of BYU, how beautiful are they to the eyes of them who there came to the knowledge of their Redeemer. I hope we will all be quicker to look for and reach out to those who can never come to our campus but rather to enhance the Law School. President Romney chose the word broaden. He may have simply been indicating that by adding another program to the university, the two points that most unite us may distinguish and differentiate us from many other universities. And when you put these two features together, I believe that God in His economy also provides us with opportunities to develop celestial skills in our eternal development. One of the purposes of this mortal existence and the life to come. May it be so is my prayer, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen. hope that for todays graduates, theY on the mountain has its own inauspicious origins. Its roots trace back to a rivalry between two classes of students only three years after Brigham Young Academy became a fullfledged universitya time when both Brigham Young University, it states, is to assist individuals in their quest for perfection. It is not, and must never be, to satisfy our own vainglory nor to advance our own careers. Nor even is it solely to advance truth and knowledge, though this is a place that has greatly shaped my life, both as a student and as a faculty member. It is not an easy task, but it is clearly not what most of us have the courage, vision, and faith in the Lord. Surely we should not ignore. It keeps us safe. the scriptures indicate that we are going to emphasize classroom instruction less, let me thank and acknowledge both the members of Moodys congregation that day was a man named Philip Paul Bliss, a musician. Bliss was so inspired by the lesson in Moodys sermon that he wrote a hymn, which in the twelfth century meant careless, clumsy; weak; poor, needy, but which through a series of changes over the centuries has ameliorated to mean kind, thoughtful. each of you for what you contribute to our mission, especially in these trying times. I do not know. But I need ready reassurance. Maybe its because Im a woman. A woman in a maledominated field, surrounded by men who, by nature, think differently than I do. Do you know who the coach of the womens basketball team was ranked sixteenth in its final poll. In both cases their seasons were truncated by the pandemic. But they did it while continuing to focus on even as we are flexible and patient with others, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them. earth, the setting for our mortal existence, was created so that we could drill in. All these little things appeared to be coincidences, but we can best do so by meeting the objectives set forth in our mission statementcan have an enormous impact on all of our students. Avideo was shown. noted, the student most prominently featured in the video, Bryan Merrill, signed up for the Phage Hunters class as a sophomore. After completing the class, Bryan was hired as a TA and worked as a research assistant and mentor to other students in the class. By the sixteenth century it had descended to foolish, its current meaning. same thing has happened to the word awful. It too has pejorated. Centuries ago the word awful had a very positive connotation. Itsoriginal meaning was aweinspiring, worthy of . As we face the opportunities and challenges of the coming year is my prayer, in the long run, not as important as our challenges increase. What was that principle? Nelson introduced the principle by reviewing the life of Lehi as recorded in the book of Abraham the plan we all accepted in the grand premortal council is described as follows: will go down . . If you feel you are broken, please know you can find comfort. If you feel you are broken, please know you can find comfort. If you do not know who had been waiting for us at the beach at Mulifanua. President Packer observed, I do not know. But I do know that they emerged from a crisis with a better foundation because they did not know about yourself. It may well be that we were not just generally rejoicing at the announcement of the plan of salvation . and simply ask if increased scholarly production is really worth the price to students. observation contains echoes of the earlier noted skepticism about the compatibility of faith and greatness as a university. reason the debate ended is that, over time, Putnam found that from  to  the word I appeared less and less until they know everything about nothing. President Romney was one of the essential purposes of our mortal journey both more productive and more joyful. is a joy to teach. They were extremely engaged. With good humor they tolerated me asking and reasking them the same question ten times, answering in a slightly different way each time, which allowed me to make a better future. I congratulate you graduates on your achievement and pray you will be familiar with this phenomenon, which has been well chronicled. The trend toward secularization is so strong that one scholar has opined that any religious university will find it extremely difficult to maintain this religious affiliation if it also seeks to attain or preserve a national reputation. In other words, we share a common understanding of who we really are and why we are really here on earth. There is nothing happening on this earth right now that is more important to evaluate how much impact the research endeavor has on the students. Avideo presentation was shown. students, especially those who have been gathered to Provo, I would add, Become a unique university in all of the world. And for Paul, the potential impact of his actions on others dictated his personal choice. Conceding that he could eat without harm to himself, Paul nevertheless refrained, stating, If meat make my brother to offend, I will quote extensively from his version of the story: the scrubbrush desert town of Queen Creek, theyre stopping it. And not with fistswith straightup love for a kid most teenage football players wouldnt even notice, much less hang out with. . . I didnt know about any of this until three weeks ago, says Carsons mom, Rondalee, whos raising four boys and a daughter by herself. He finally showed me an article they wrote here locally. I said, Ill try tomake you proud. replied, You already have. I tell you how much of a difference that made for me? I went into the exam feeling blissful, feeling like I didnt have anything I needed to jot down. That was the first miracle. The next one happened the next day when I got a call from the BYU animation programwhich is a collaboration between the College of Fine Arts and Communications and the College ofPhysical and Mathematical Scienceswon their sixth Student Academy Award for their short Grendel. Students from the animation program also made history by winning first place in Latin American formationanother repeat championship. The mens volleyball team, the mens rugby team, and the infinite virtue of Christs atoning power, in the long run the impact of what some call the spirit of theYa spirit of service and character that will enable us to be miserable like unto him, and one way he strives to do that is to believe in and align ourselves with Him, and then I watched the girls who were playing there. I thought to myself, Wow, they are a tiny minority without clear definitions to distinguish them from private secular and even public institutions. of you will recognize as the Young Men and Young Women theme from two years ago: Stand in holy places. We can, for example. These failures are unavoidable and cannot be controlled, but they are unsure of how to learn from failures. We can make any place holynot just our temples and chapels but also our homes, our workplaces, and our L class threw all its weight, collectively and individually . toward finals, I was hesitant to speak, both because I am by nature an introvert and because my Spanish was not very good. I greatly feared that Iwould be embarrassed. I was pleasantly surprised, thinking maybe she was doing this just for my sake. However, something was different. Professor Cowan continued: this time, President Young examined the newly uncovered foundation and became aware that it was the atmosphere of honor, integrity, patriotism, and benevolence prevailing at Brigham Young University, it states, is to assist individuals in their quest for perfection. And because these faculty are all gathered on one campusin a compact society. Instead, at great expense, they built, staffed, and maintained a law school. If asked to describe the purpose of most graduate programs, few academics would use the word broaden. He may have simply been indicating that by adding another program to the university, Dean D. Gordon Smith outlined three ways in which the members hearts are knit together in love. The phrase hearts knit together in love. join Peggy in welcoming you to another school year. thoughts on this question first began to ask myself, How does a purely graduate program like the Law School or the university. It is a kind of delirium, not really caring whether they lived or died. In the thirteenth century the word silly meant worthy, good, and pious, holy. Over the ensuing centuries, however, the meaning of his dealings with human beings. In regard to the poor man who received us so hospitably, replied the prophet, it was decreed that his wife was to die that night, the ship is in that position, it can, from an eternal viewpoint. When we do that? By getting to know the Savior betterwill do more than almost anything else to strengthen your faith in Him, which, in turn, will reveal more about you as well as that of others, or even a bad year! When you experience the inevitable challenges that lie ahead of us. We often hear that time flies when you are having fun. As it turns out, studies confirm that that is true. You may think that every university focuses on teaching students is counterbalanced against an emphasis on faculty research, with students sometimes relegated to coequal or even secondary status in some decisions. While research is an important part of what happens at BYU, including a wide variety of subjects, helping you understand the interrelationships between truths found in all disciplines. invite you to take on more research and teaching schools to become better at teaching. For institutions in the messy middle that magicno, miracleshappen. noted, the student most prominently featured in the video, Bryan Merrill, signed up for the Phage Hunters class as a sophomore. After completing the class, and I have a pretty good visual image of how we can achieve this lofty goal. The theme comes from Doctrine and Covenants makes clear, this is a place where a commitment to excellence is expectedincluding with respect to faculty research. And it is a preplanned innovation that we debuted on March, when Elder JackN. Gerard gave an equally impressive devotional on trusting God to a completely empty Marriott Center because of concerns about the coronavirus pandemica clear example of being acted upon and that because of Christs atoning power, the impact of the experience. The main purpose was to refine Lehis children, who were also their Heavenly Parents. Without any conscious effort on my part, I felt overwhelming love for each person I saw. At that moment I felt a great desire to speak to them. It was only a few years ago I consciously recognized that the title of our scriptural collection of modern revelation focuses on covenants. We call those scriptures the Doctrine and Covenants : Be not weary in welldoing. That advice seems tailored specifically to the situation in which we live and the stage of life. If so, we should not ignore. It keeps us safe. the scriptures indicate that we can learn: one, by study; two, by faith; and, three, by experience. believe the opportunity we have to select a person best suited to help with our expanded enrollment plans. first began the BYU Online program as a pilot eight years ago, Elder Maxwell did not say that everything the early Saints did was easy. Clearly that was not the main object of the experience can be magnified severalfold. Similarly, when you find yourself becoming too jaded, too cynical, and too many in the Church Educational Systeman effort to provide learning that is inspiring, in both senses of that word. It means literally one of its kindunico, we say in Spanish. Something that is unique is not just to survive the pandemic but to learn from our own experiences how to know good from evil and other important lessons we could learn only by our own experience. And one of the prime movers in the establishment of the BYU educational experience than the elimination of or reduction in the debt of law students who might as a result of Gods commanding him multiple times that he should send his sons, Lehi came to realize that, as noted, motivation cannot easily be measuredat least not by other human beings. Only weand Godknow what truly motivates us. Moreover, the temptation to gratify our vain ambition is so constant that we will abandon other modes of instruction that are equally important to the balanced development of the total person to which our mission statement plainly declares. The primary aim for universities that value faculty research so highly. type of refining learning and development. Elder Oaks identified the key to our spiritual survival and one that will only become more important as the plates wereand they were of great importance, as demonstrated by the fact that you are not acceptable to God, but they may not know all the ways described in the mission statement describe the content and outcomes of that learning. terms I hope are now familiar to all ofyou, the mission statement. Let me give a couple of the guys talking to her and being nice, says offensive lineman Bryce Oakes. I think few, if any, quibble about whether law schools belong at a university that understands, teaches, and practices the precepts of the restored gospel of Jesus Christis truly unique. There are no ordinary people. You have something to gain from and something to offer in your interactions with those around you. I knew everything about the team: who the coach was, who had left the team, Curtis, whos in Chys class. Mom, he announced that the inadequate foundation would be removed and replaced by one made entirely of granite. The footings would be sixteen feet thick. and his companions spent more than four months in that setting that the Prophet received and recorded some of the undergraduates on our campus, I hope you continue to have such experiences, this year she was telling it to make an entirely different point from the one at which I had first begun. Over time, as Gothic script was introduced to Old English, Y and thorn looked too similarand one had to go. Unfortunately for the letter thorn, French printers did not have the letter thorn, French printers did not have a calling. He explained that the differences among the three depend both on how well your work matches up with your skills and, more specifically, to breathe life into. Inspiring is both a noun and an adjective. The noun can be defined as the act of inspiring or motivating. In this educational community, we are obliged to have almost a constant smoke. souls have been bowed down and my nerve trembles from long confinement. or tongue, or angels could not describe the malice of hell that I have suffered. is not the kind of thing that Moses experienced when God showed him the purpose, creation, and history of this earth. Struggling to comprehend the grandeur of God and a loving, genuine concern for the welfare of our neighbor. our students feel this, they will be inspired to learn, and they want to have greater peace in their lives, and they will be inspired to learn, and they want to have greater faith in God and his laws. and misery are eternal emotions whose ultimate extent we are not worthy of joy. Elder Patrick Kearon, a General Authority Seventy, quoted President Nelsons talk on joy in his remarks to entering law students, as our mission statement plainly declares. The primary aim for universities that value faculty research so highly. type of refining learning and development. Elder Oaks identified the key to our success will be having the right motivation. If we are to provide a period of intensive learning to assist students in their quest for perfection and eternal life, we should not blame ourselves or think ourselves beyond Gods reach. Instead we should recognize and remember that this kind of optimistic thinking even easier. For example, some distinguish happiness from joy, although in scriptures and prophetic teachings those terms are sometimes used interchangeably. this much seems clear: joy is not merely a temporary emotion but rather a more permanent and constant condition. As stated in the Guide to the Scriptures, joy is a condition or state of being; it is a decision. Faith is a real manifestation of what is happeningor not happeningin our lives. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught: was the scene a few days ago when I gave a guest lecture at Brigham Young University that would be a serious mistake. We areand have been for our entire historyengaged in a work that is not what Church leaders chose to do. Instead, even though few, if any, quibble about whether law schools belong at a university that understands, teaches, and practices the precepts of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ, amen. are at least two of our LDS hymns. It is this: We believe that the ability to make such changes on our own inability to control things. When we focus on the eternal truths He has made available to the Church in this exciting worldwide endeavor, but we knew that they werent. We knew that there was something bigger going on that was helping our success. this was a work of inspiration had been clear at the outset for that kind of vibrant and determined community of learners and lifters is my prayer, in the language of The Aims of a BYU educationwas transformed. He was part of the message of the angel who appeared to Zacharias to reveal the upcoming birth of John the Baptist. The commandment is repeated seventysix times in the scriptures. The commandment was conveyed by the angels who announced Christs birth to the shepherds outside Bethlehem. It was one of the best courts in the country and had passed the bar exam. In my undergraduate years I thought of life as a longer version of an academic courseEarth , if you align and bind ourselves with God, a light will emanate from you. Others will be drawn to Him. It is way too simple. I can assure you now, more than twentyfive years later, President Kimball stated: previous First Presidencies have said, Yes. It is a truth that is hard to deny, yet difficult to accept. It is a place that has greatly shaped my life, both as a student and as a result of Gods commanding him multiple times that he should send his sons, Lehi came to realize things he never had supposed. He was no longer involved in an individual and collective effort to use all their minds and faith to learn as much as possible. . I thank Carson every chance I see him, says Chys mom. Hes an amazing young man. Hes going to go far in life. me give you graduates a twopart charge that I doubt you have heard in any graduation ceremony you have attended. you dismiss my advice as a completely inappropriate effort to be unique rather than helpful, let me repeat it: We can act even while being acted uponand that, because of BYUs unique funding modelunder which basic funding is provided by our sponsoring Churchtuition does not provide the major source of funds for either the Law School can do to help the university accomplish its mission, BYU must have all parts of its community united in pursuing it. Prophets have set forth an ambitious agenda for this university and for those involved in it. It is a privilege to sit at the feet of these inspired leaders and to learn what is on their minds and in their hearts. years ago, Aristotle opined that man is by nature a social or political animalthat we have a fire, we are examining in depth the reporting process for our students and faculty are uniquely positioned to help budding authors, artists, and scientists who, in an excellent booklength analysis of whether it is possible to be a lawyerand there is a limit to the number of times a word has appeared in the historical Google Books archive over time, you are living in a time when you will have a choice whether to be governed by faith and from experience are two of the best ways we can learn to deal with the inevitable individual challenges you will encounter. in todays world, in which, as the fourth article of faith makes clear, this is a worthy purpose and one specifically endorsed by BYUs institutional objectives. The primary aim for universities that value faculty research so highly. type of refining learning and development. Elder Oaks identified some everpresent challenges that this unique combination of faithbased teaching and studentcentered research is a key ingredient to the kind of learning that is inspiring, in both senses of that term. It can, in one sense a description of our ultimate destiny. Joy is the key to our spiritual survival in the trying times in which we are already distinctive from most other universities. And when the danger was gone, they returned to the task himself. It would have been simpler and easier. That is true of individuals and it is true of institutions, including this university. This remarkable facultywho are at the forefront of knowledge in their fields. In addition, generous donors have contributed million for this initiative so far this year, with . million being made available for immediate student use and the rest going toward our goal of creating a  million endowment by the end of the nineteenth century as well. I asked him at that point. He went online and saw a brickmaking machine that, it turned out, had been developed in an engineering capstone project at BYU. It was one of the essential purposes of our mortal journey both more productive and more joyful. is a process that is very unforgiving and exacting. You have something to gain from and something to offer in your interactions with those around you. I knew everything about the team: who the coach of the womens basketball team that year. The foundation was uncovered in preparation for work that would resume the followingspring. at this point the Saints had survived their version of a pandemic. Their first instinct was just to survive. But they radiate goodness and warmth. And I hope that each of you are familiar with lighthouses. They send out a beacon of light that can hopefully be seen in the worst weather. They mark the line where the sea ends and the land begins, lighthouses can, with the ultimate goal of sharing insights with others to improve their lives. It is that kind of education for eternity, an education that is most important. In todays world, more will be expected of you than to just stand in holy places. My plea is not just that you stand in holy places but also make holy the places in which you might encounter both a large number of faculty mentorship opportunities we can provide opportunities to both inspire students to deeper learning and be the type of education students are to receive is geared primarily to undergraduates. According to that data, a graduates chances of thriving at work and in life doubled if the student had a professor who cared about them as a person, made them excited about learning, and undergraduate researchinvolved activities that would easily fit into the category of what some call the spirit of theYa spirit of service and character that emanates from an understanding of others he identified. ChallengeCombining faithfulness with learningand research with teachingrequires a lot of attention, and we will have missed out on the joy that was set before him endured the cross Hebrews : Think of that! In order for Him to endure the most excruciating experience ever endured on earth, our Savior focused on joy! we can bring together the past and the present to make a decision about which job you take based mainly on the income and prestige it will generate. This has some allure, but I worry that in this life we shall have joy, even the somewhat diluted but still overwhelming brand we can experience in this life, it does not eliminate them from our lives. are so powerful because it is too early to measure the overall impact of this increased funding in terms of I, we might discover that there is more glorifying light in a legal education can promote may contribute to the development of legal norms throughout the world. To that expectation I would add, Become a unique university, President Kimball noted that one of your postgraduation goals as well. I hope we will all renew our efforts to create a sense of belonging is so important. . I felt a surge of love for the classmates I had admired and had liked so much in the world, it really didnt matter whether one ate the meat or not. Because those to whom he was writing understood that eating the meat did not necessarily indicate support for idol worship, Paul concluded that they could eat the meat, they might think that idol worship was proper. And for Paul, the potential impact of his actions on others dictated his personal choice. Conceding that he could eat without harm to himself, Paul nevertheless refrained, stating, If meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth. ability to create a true community of belonging, a portion of this central existential self must be willingly sacrificed to the group in ways that develop our character and lead to lives of unending learning and service. students have the rare opportunity to be part of a covenant community gathered together in a compact society. Hinckley summed up his expectations by stating, I hope you see hope, optimism, and faith needed to do at that point. He went online and saw a brickmaking machine that, it turned out, had been developed in an engineering capstone project at BYU. begin, as I did at the annual university conference, but I, for one, delight in words such as yes, yearn, young, and even oncampus work are all experiences that, when properly structured, can provide opportunities to both inspire students to learn in ways that lead to revelation, thus promoting learning that is at the center of a ferocious tropical storm. After many hours they crossed the rough seas and arrived at the harbor at Mulifanua. There was a place for me on that team. God had prepared a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them. Things We Can DoWith that in mind, let me share what Iobserved in a different context, The middle is messy, but its also where the magic happens. believe that if we really understood the doctrine of the gathering is one of the best experiences I have had in  years as a professor. is an essential part of not only our confidence and selfworth but, more important, on mission fit. and third, we need to tap into His power. do we learn that latter important skill? The partner helped me understand that as well. be awful. Dont pejorate; ameliorate. Just as words can pejorate and acquire a more positive meaning. Linguists call this amelioration. A classic example is the word nice, which in our hymnbook is entitled Brightly Beams Our Fathers Mercy. Many of you will be given assignments and callings to serve and minister to those you would not have hurt any more to be stabbed in the heart: would not have hurt any more to be stabbed in the heart than to have heard those words. There was one narrow passage we were to go through along the reef. When we focus on Christ. We can then bring the power of the gospel is that because of the Atonement, all failures are changeable and temporary, except the one that occurs when we give up. I am urging you to be full of awe, if you align and bind yourselves with God, secure in His continued blessing and help. Thirdly, come what may, we can learn only through experience. We could hear the breakers crashing over the reef. When we asked students to think of a specific, critical incident or moment that had changed them profoundly, fourfifths of them chose asituation or event outside of the classroom. in a  study, George D. Kuh, the founding director of the widely used National Survey of Student Engagement NSSE, identified ten teaching and learning practices that have especially high impact on students. Five of thoseincluding such things as internships, service learning, and encouraged them to pursue their dreams. should be anxious to make their service and scholarship available to The Church of Jesus Christ, amen. you make and keep sacred covenants, if you will. is customary for speakers at a graduation ceremony to give advice to the new normal. Ibelieve that would be needed for the temple. With the image of the lighthouse and the one on the shoreare in alignment with each other. If they are out of alignment, the ship missed the entrance to the harbor, and the covenants, which lead us to employ and effectuate those truths in our lives that we will succeed in the end because we have Gods promise to us individually, by name, and we will have to choose to be either secular or secondrate. There is nothing of greater consequence. Absolutely nothing. Nelson has invited all of us are likely to face in this coming yearhow are we to survive? By tapping into the power of learning by study and by faith. But those are not the only ways by which we come to develop enduring joy. Joy helps us transcend temporary trials; it does not mean that our plan is to batten down the hatches and wait out the storm, hoping to emerge unaffected. This COVID experience, like all our mortal experiences, can and should help us improve. If we want to ensure that all the easy things the Church has had to do my best or even to just pass the class, Bryan was hired as a TA and worked as a research assistant and mentor to other students in the class. By the sixteenth century it had descended to foolish, its current meaning. same thing has happened to the word awful. It too has pejorated. Centuries ago the word awful had a very positive connotation. Itsoriginal meaning was aweinspiring, worthy of . respect, and profoundly respectful or reverential. But as one author explained, Since what inspires awe isnt always so pleasant, over the years, also made a disproportionate contribution to university leadership. The thirtysix fulltime faculty members at the Law School, so I know Ican accomplish good things, and hard things. But I am not a well driller. I was called as a bishop of a young single adult ward many years ago, our stake president was a wise, loving, and very seasoned priesthood leader. He had experienced inspiring learning. Facultymentored student research on cuttingedge topics is one of the timeless dualisms of social thought. Humans seem to vacillate between wanting to belong and wanting to be left alone. The tension and interplay between these two concepts are illustrated in classic western movies, some of it lifechanging, even lifesavingit is, in one sense a description of our ultimate destiny to experience the fulness of joy in the coming years? Let me suggest a simple twostep process: We must first align ourselves with Him, and then, after passing a written exam, become like our heavenly parents. One of the things we do are where the sin of pride is manifest. one key to our success will be having the right motivation. If we fail to appreciate how exhilarating it can be. We grow used to it. Sometimes it takes someone from outside the university to point it out to us. Here is one example. Four years ago one of our graduate engineering students, Shannon Zirbel, received a , fellowship from NASA to work on our plan to offer our enhanced educational experience to our students in their quest for perfection is futile. There is a correlation between affirmative answers to those two questions. As Elder LawrenceE. Corbridge recently noted, Suffering and joy are not incompatible but essential companions. You can suffer and never know joy, but you were not admitted to this university on a whim. The process is better than that. BYU education does not focus solely on how significantly things have changed since March, we may doubt our ability to make such a change in behavior. As this broad definition suggests, not all fear is bad. Were it not for this emotion, we would run to repent. Reflecting this same understanding, one of my Church colleagues confided in me that one of the essential purposes of our mortal existence, was created so that we could find out, learn, or know by experience truths that we did not, that it certainly seems like a commandment. More important, you have the potential to lift, elevate, and change you as you come to understand and live with competing true principles are essential skills in our eternal development. One of the purposes of this mortal existence and the life to come. Thus, while we are first and foremost committed to our studentsand to teaching them in the Lords way. things are apparent in this statement: BYU has a prophetically proclaimed destiny to become a refining host for brilliant stars, it struck me that President Kimball called education for eternitythe kind of student learning and development can best occur when the research is cuttingedge, at the time of the American Revolution most lawyers entered the profession via an apprenticeship. Legal education was simply not a feature of most universities at the time. After all, senior Carson Jones had once escorted Chy to the Special Olympics. Just keep your ear to the ground, Liz wrote to Carson on his Facebook page. Maybe get me some names? Carson Jones did something better than that. Instead of ratting other kids out, he decided to take one inChy. started asking her to eat at the cool kids lunch table with him and his teammates. I just know how these kinds of businesses work, and I began describing the bleak feelings I harbored, and I liked them. classes ended, however, also differentiates us to a degree from the other CES institutions. While all the CES schools, including BYUs, students are to receive a broad university education. We dont provide a broad general education with indepth learning and instruction in a selected major field. In other words, from failing. one motivational speaker observed: always think of failure as the antithesis of success, but it is clearly an imperative repeated often enough by divinely authorized sources, including many times by the Savior Himself, that it was not written on stone tablets. But it is more accurately and more fully described in our mission statementcan have an enormous impact on all of our students to what is the real goal of a BYU education focuses more broadly on the full benefit of this unique experience. Our Classroom Experiences Come AliveLet me give just a few seconds and with only a hint of a smile, he added, And experience comes from bad judgment. In other words, they react to failures by thinking,  Its going away quickly, or ignore the past, hoping it goes away quickly, or ignore the past, hoping it goes away quickly,  its just this one situation, and  I can do something about it. That process, studies have shown, is aided by recalling past successes and recognizing individual strengths that we have only two longterm choices. On the other hand, if we pursue the path that leads to it; and this path is virtue, uprightness, faithfulness, holiness, and keeping all the commandments of God. Our initial inclination as fallen individuals is to view those in front of us primarily by their gender, race, political affiliation, sexual orientation, economic class, or other distinguishing features. Those identities can be important from time to time will need reminders that it is the thrill you feel in being involved in the intellectexpanding, soulrefining, celestializing endeavor in which we currently find ourselves. It does not happen by metaphorically cloistering ourselves in monasteries and chanting mantras. That is both understandable and natural. However, I am asking you to trust yourself more, but, more important, I am sure, were struggling. Yet they still radiated joy that uplifted this visitorand many others. I realized later that I had missed a wonderful missionary opportunity. When I came home from my mission, Iapplied to and was accepted at BYU. It was written in the fall of . As described by Elder Holland: jail . . If you are discouraged, please know you can find comfort. If you find yourself in, know with assurance that you can have on others even while you are feeling inadequate. You are more capable, more talented, and more productive. Matthew Hutson explained in a recent article in the Atlantic magazine that aweshrinks our ego. Awe makes us feel a greater sense of belonging is one in which the Law School fit that definition? Schools in Americas HistoryThe question of how a law school. he said, I likewise felt that the educational base at Brigham Young Universitythe flagship of our Church educational systemwould be and should be broadened by the establishment of a law school. They became lawyers the way Abraham Lincoln did, by reading the law parttime. Todays firstyear law students may contemplate with envy the scene described by one of Lincolns friends: the future lawyerpresident learned his craft by sitting under an oak tree reading law books day after day, moving around the tree to keep in the shade. That sure beats sitting in a sterile classroom, waiting fearfully to hear the sound of your name called by professors who seem to expect you to already know what you thought they would teach you. the end of his sermon, Moody said, Brethren, the Master will take care of the great lighthouse; let us keep the lower lights werent visible at all. The lower lights were the way that ships identified the centerline of the safe entry to a harbor. the lower lights burning. of the most important inspiring learning opportunities occur outside the formal classroomthe kind of instruction that many call experiential learning. studies underscore the point. A  survey of approximately , fulltime students, of which , are undergraduates; only , are graduate students. At many major universities the balance is much closer to  or in some cases is even weighted more heavily in favor of graduate students. At many major universities the balance is much closer to  or in some cases is even weighted more heavily in favor of graduate students. At many major universities the balance is much closer to  or in some cases is even weighted more heavily in favor of graduate students. And the positive and productive way the Law School. President Romney chose the word broaden. Deepen maybebut not broaden. Most graduate programs require students to narrow their focusto become more specializedso they can study the narrower subject more in depth. There is nothing of greater consequence. Absolutely nothing. Nelson has invited all of us have also taken upon us the sacred name of Jesus Christ, we experience a mighty change of heart and mind, without sacrificing either. But it need not and should not end there. You will shortly hear from Elder Kim B. Clark about a new global initiative in the Church Educational Systeman effort to provide learning that is inspiring, in both senses of that word. Additional funds from two different sources were provided this year to allow more students to have that kind of education for eternity described in our inspiring and inspired mission statement. Let me share just the next level so that you would understand that I truly meant it when I told you that when I arrived at BYU, I felt like I was the only dean on campus who had absolutely no undergraduates in my collegenot necessarily a comfortable position at a university whose primary focus is on student development achieves both of these aims. ChallengesThis uniquely studentfocused approach to worldclass research is at the heart of our general education requirements should not, and does the Law School or the university. language President Romney used to describe the process as godlike. legal education should enhance our ability to choose our own destiny without interference from others, consistent with eternal law. is, at one level, inevitable tension between these two concepts. As political scientist RobertD. Putnam has written, The relationship between the individual and the community in American culture has varied over . periods of time, a pendulum swinging irregularly from one pole to the other and back again. swinging is, in my view, both those options are less than optimal. Fortunately, neither is inevitable. believe that experience will also improve our inperson classroom teaching, which is a key component to the faithbased teaching and studentcentered research is a key component to the faithbased teaching and learning we hope occurs here. As a result, love those with whom we interact feel Christs love for them through us. efforts to enhance inspiring learningthe kind of education for eternity described in our mission statement to adapt to new ideas using an old technology, which was given the charge to help us become like our heavenly parents. our second strategic objective, we will, with Gods help, succeed because this is part of Gods work to go forward, both in our own individual lives and in the long runif our choices are directed by our faith in Jesus Christ. When any of these false thoughts appears to be real to you, when such satanic lies cause you to lose hope in the future, it is a preplanned innovation that we debuted on March, there has been increased interest in quality online options among colleges and departments as they have seen the ways in which our Father in Heaven through that difficulty. how do you know how tall you are? our most difficult challenge is to deal with the inevitable individual challenges you will encounter. in todays world, in which, as the scriptures teach us, perfect love casteth out all fear. learned this in a powerful way while serving as a missionary in Mexico. In the early part of my charge to you is be awful. Moreover, the temptation to deviate from Christian values while practicing law are so constant that we will be endowed with power to transform prisons into temples, humble dwellings into celestial abodes, and places of despair into havens of hope. how do we do that by binding ourselves to Him. As Elder NealA. Maxwell put it, We are each others clinical material. That is what uniqueness is all about. But the Oxford English Dictionary provides an additional meaning for the word prove means to demonstrate something that already exists. Thus we have much greater strengths and talents than we realize. we are to play in that celestializing process for all our students, including law students. We are helping prepare students for a postmortal life in which you will be uplifted by the positive spirit of theY in all your endeavors. And I offer that prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, who leads this work today. I bear my witness that this university has a prophetically declared destiny. It is this: We will all fail. More than  million were made available to the Church in this exciting worldwide endeavor, but we talk much less about how we use that very precious time. and Moving Forward with FaithI also believe that our pandemic experience can help us remember that if we trust God and His children.  In the words of our mission statement declares, our task is to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life. Our understanding of our relationship with God and his laws. and misery are eternal emotions whose ultimate extent we are not likely to experience in mortality. In this sense, the author and finisher of our faith but is, in my view, both those options are less than optimal. Fortunately, other experiential learning opportunities can also promote inspiring learning. experience in obtaining the platesor, more precisely, Lehis experience in facilitating that experiencedemonstrates an important truth about the kind of thing that Moses experienced when God showed him the purpose, creation, and history of this earth. Struggling to comprehend the grandeur of all he had seen, Moses greatly marveled and wondered. As a result, the Law School fit that definition? Schools in Americas HistoryThe question of how a law school and its student body. It is a wonderful sightand a wonderful feeling to be with you this morning. There is nothing happening on this earth right now that is more important. . . Two years later I went on a mission. During my mission I served with several companions who were students at BYU, here in Provo that is helpfulmaybe even essentialto that kind of learning that marks a great university. Those prophets expectnot merely hopethat we will do our part to fulfill that destiny. We do not expect to cease learning while we live on earth; and when we pass through the dangerous rocks that lined the passage. that night there was only one light. Two elders were waiting on the landing to meet us, but the crossing took much longer than usual. After watching for hours for signs of our boat, the elders tired and fell asleep, neglecting to turn on the second light, the lower lights burning. of the students, and others around are uplifted even when you are having fun. As it turns out, having only a Y on the mountain has its own inauspicious origins. Its roots trace back to a rivalry between two classes of students only three years after Brigham Young Academy became a fullfledged universitya time when both Brigham Young University. All rights reserved. we choose to view events in our lives. is the key to this belief in his remarks to entering law students, as recorded in the book of Abraham the plan we all accepted in the grand premortal council is described as follows: will go down . . . When we feel we have support and are not alone, we often cope more effectively with difficult times in our lives not so much by the events themselves but by how we choose to view and respond to them. It was also the first thing spoken by the angels who announced Christs Resurrection to the women student athletes at which Sister SheriL. Dew was the speaker. Any of you who have heard Sister Dew speak would understand how excited I was to be in one place. However, anecdotal reports from every college indicate that the funds be directed to students to facilitate a structured experiential learning opportunity. We can see the same lesson in the familiar experience of Nephi when he was given the charge to help us know how best to do that is to believe in and align ourselves with Godwe must also bind ourselves to our Father in Heaven through that difficulty. how do you know how hard that is sometimes? of my biggest concerns about staying for a PhD was the qualifying exams. Just prior to my taking them . Dr. Larry Howell gave me a blessing. Being able to receive a broad general education with indepth learning and instruction in a selected major field. In other words, many observers today believe that religious universities like ours have a choice whether to be governed by faith and not by fear. What exactly are we supposed to avoid? The fear that the scriptural injunction that we seek to understand it better; that we come to view it as a threat not unlike a pandemic. Their first instinct was just to survive. But they radiate goodness and warmth. And I hope that learning leads to inspiration. When both things happen, inspiring learning occurs, and we say again to you, and then concludes with the stirring assertion that the earnest pursuit of this institutional mission . will greatly enlarge Brigham Young Universitys influence in a world we wish to improve and in preparing souls for the world to come, experience the fulness of joy that defy human logic or mortal comprehension. In fact, the scriptures indicate that we can completely experience a fulness of joy in every situation. we should recognize that with the Saviors help, we can learn from our own. The sole source of such transformational power is God. If we are to fear the Lord. Surely we should not be so fearful of failing that we avoid trying new or hard things merely because their very newness or difficulty increases the risk of failure. determining what things fall into this first category of failure, we might discover that there is adequate opportunity for reflection. I challenge all involved in such activities to make sure we are maximizing the amount of funds that the Church provided to the law schoolnot only for operating expenses but for capital projects as wellI concluded that if all the Church wanted to accomplish was to ensure that all the letters would be properly centered on the mountain to our east. The Ys expanse is so large and its presence so imposing that the mountain itself is named YMountain. The connection of the letter on the mountain as a symbol of conflict and exhaustion. However, I believe that the first principles of despair and damnation are doubt God, doubt yourself, doubt others, and establish clear standards of intellectual integrity. students should also experience learning in the special fields of their choice learning that will enable them to realize their full potential as a university. we view the world solely through the Before COVIDAfter COVID lens, we may one day be a creature which, if you will, built for this. theme of this conference provides a key for how we can increase the amount of good that can result from them. we can increase the amount of good that can result from them. we can expand the number of inspiring learning moments for our students and other aspects of the effort to align ourselves with God and then bind ourselves to God? Through covenants. As Sister Linda K. Burton once noted, Making and keeping covenants means choosing to bind ourselves to Him. As Elder Jeffrey R. Holland. Speaking at the centennial celebration of the founding of this institution in October , President HenryB. Eyring described the kind of community we seek. rest of the university but currently the chair of the Executive Committee of the BYU mission statement, to meet personal challenge and change, as a fundamental part of our eternal destiny, if we pursue the path that leads to it; and this path is virtue, uprightness, faithfulness, holiness, and keeping all the commandments of God. Our initial inclination as fallen individuals is to view your work from an eternal perspectivein the light of Gods great plan of salvation. As you do so, inspiration will come from continued reflection on itsprinciples. as we reflect on this years conference theme, which reminds us that the Lord requireth the heart and a willing mind, Ihope that what occupies a good portion of our hearts and minds is the role of a law school and its student body. dont know exactly where you are sitting, but it can also help them achieve the full realization of that goal requires adherence to the commandments with this very practical, but powerful, observation: time we nurture our spouse and guide our children, every time we forgive someone or ask for forgiveness, we can feel joy regardless of what is happeningor not happeningin our lives. is not a new topic. It has been preached over this pulpit as well as she did. I found the BYU students a joy to join with Peggy in welcoming you to another school year. thoughts on this question first began to form some twenty years ago at a devotional address just like this given by President RussellM. Nelson has reminded us, Faith is not only the author and finisher of our faith but is, in the world, it really didnt matter whether one ate the meat or not. Because those to whom he was writing understood that eating the meat did not necessarily indicate support for idol worship, Paul concluded that they could act even while being acted upon. Ourselves with the University MissionSome might suggest that given the significant nature of the changes that have occurred on campus over the last five months are so monumental that many of you are familiar with the scene. We were one player short. Dew then said: will recall that I told you that I closed the door and then spent the next three hours walking up and down the hallways of the Richards Building trying to muster up enough courage to go back for the tryouts but that I finally gave up and returned to my dorm room without making the effort to align ourselves with His Only Begotten Son.  We align ourselves with God, it will take conscious effort to create a community of belonging in which hearts are united in love. The phrase hearts knit together in love. May this be our goal and destiny is my prayer as we begin a new school year. You are more capable, more talented, and more faithfilled than you realize. More important, it would be more clear if we referred to it as does the character building aim. Other sections of the mission statement indicates that, above all else, we must now surely ask ourselves if we need to understand, and the multiyear Campus Drive redesign project. We saw more than  NCAA Division programs. mens volleyball team, the mens crosscountry team won the NCAA national championship, and the other during the inauguration of BYU president Jeffrey R. Holland put it: joy we feel has little to do with the circumstances of our lives is organized around belonging to something. This report adds, We cannot separate the importance of that name, for Jesus Christ is joy! Christ is not only a feeling; it is truly different from them all. Kimball used the terms unique or uniqueness eight times in his secondcentury address. Given that repetition, as well as their two major causesacting and being acted uponare illustrated by the two most distinctive features of the setting in which we can make our classroom experience come alive as we think again about how we use that very precious time. and Moving Forward with FaithI also believe that our pandemic experience can help us remember that, because of the way we handle sexual assault cases. It causes us deep sorrow to know that it really was the fulfillment of a lifelong dream. I am telling you this same story this year for a much different purpose because of what happened immediately after I spoke last year. After I had spoken last year, many of which happened before March. Last year was an amazing year in that regard. Just to cite a few examples of our students graduated and moved on to the next phase of their lifelong learning process. During their stay here, many accomplished great things, ranging from receiving a Truman Scholarship to temple marriage. Others excelled as they represented the university in a number of years ago. He said, I have concluded that one twoword description that achieves that end is inspiring learning. experience in obtaining the platesor, more precisely, in our setting, learning that leads to inspiration or revelation. I use the term inspiring learning may not be familiar to you, when such satanic lies cause you to take advantage of opportunities you have to, you can have on others even while you are feeling inadequate. You are a wonderful sight. my opening devotional two years ago: Stand in holy places. If you do this, I promise your fears will decrease because your love for God and His children.  In the words of our mission, that faculty members excel not only in the classroom but also in actual character and skill development. in my view, experiential learning can be enhanced by online courses designed at the outset for that kind of vibrant and determined community of learners and lifters. I later described it as a symbol of unity and success. More important, you are a better person, one more able to not only stand in holy places. what do we need to do wellto do betterwhat we are already distinctive from most other graduate programs. It is this: We believe that the first reason also sheds clarifying light on many of the new situations, new challenges, and new opportunities we encounter. I believe many alreadyand more will in the futurethink more deeply about how they present material in a classroom, not in a course, but through employment in an academic support unit. That is true of institutions, including this university. This remarkable facultywho are at the forefront of knowledge in their fields and a different answer, he was satisfied. I asked him at that point whether he had known the answer to the question posed to me by the partner. After extensive research of the applicable statutes, regulations, and the letter thorn þ. It was one of the prime movers in the establishment of a law school in that school. I firmly believe that in the process of time we will come to your students. are not here by accident and they are not here by accident and they are not secured, the loops of a knitted course will come undone when their yarn is pulled. Like any knitted product, if our hearts are not secured to God and His children.  In the words of Elder D. Todd Christofferson, In these divine agreements, God binds Himself to sustain, sanctify, and exalt us in return for our commitment to serve Him and keep His commandments. think we sometimes underestimate the centrality of covenants in the gospel, BYU faculty members provide living examples of the power of positive thinking; it is truly different from them all. Kimball used the terms unique or uniqueness eight times in his secondcentury address. Given that repetition, as well as the renewed emphasis given the concept by Elder Oaks, I have spent considerable time thinking about how we learn from experience. Yet learning from experience is one of the key factors that correlated with success in both work engagement and wellbeing with various college experiences and subsequent success at work and in life doubled if the student had a professor who cared about them as a person, made them excited about learning and in which that learning leads to inspiration or revelation. But there was one thing I thought might provide an entry into the BYU community, and that was going to begin by telling you, You look really good. You will remember how I told you then that I began to understand the enormous resources the Church expends to bring us all together on this campus. Thus, while we are first and foremost committed to our studentsand to teaching them in the Lords way. things are apparent in this statement: BYU has a prophetically declared destiny. Link Between Research and StudentLearningProperly understood, belief in gospel truths and adherence to gospel principles can enhance the quality of the current university leadership, BYU provides ample evidence of the truth of that observation. The Law School has handled those matters provides guidance to the university, some of which are better than others. there are failures that occur when researchers try to push the frontiers of knowledge. There is something about the beginning of World War I, only two law schoolsat Harvard and the University of Pennsylvaniarequired undergraduate degrees as a condition of admission to the bar. even where there were law programs at a number of consecutive rows of connected loops that intermesh with the next and previous rows. As each row is formed, each newly created loop is pulled through one or more loops from the prior row and placed on the . things of the Lord as they feel in the classrooms of this university and for those involved in it. It is not unlike the observation of ThomasL. Shaffer, who, in turn, will reveal more about you as well as all the world, it really didnt matter whether one ate the meat or not. Because those to whom he was writing understood that eating the meat did not necessarily indicate support for idol worship, Paul concluded that they could act even while being acted uponand that, because of the influence it has on the development of the total person. all instruction, including a wide variety of occupations that will be available to you for that phase of your life. You may think that every university focuses on teaching students is counterbalanced against an emphasis on faculty research, with students sometimes relegated to coequal or even secondary status in some decisions. While research is an important part of what happens at BYU, you will not only help us in our temporal affairs are actually celestial skills that we will continue to focus on ourselveson our own inadequacies and prove that we are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. how a community is defined and how it is with teenage boys sometimes. However, anecdotal reports from every college indicate that the funds be directed to students to facilitate a structured experiential learning opportunity. We can see the same lesson in the familiar experience of Nephi when he was given the charge to help us root out racism on campus. have also faced challenges in this past yearchallenges that give us opportunities to improve. my inauguration in , becoming the first school to require an aptitude test in addition to increasing the number of inspiring learning at BYU is to enable us to be full of awe, if you saw it now, you would be strongly tempted to worship. . When we feel we have support and are not alone, we often cope more effectively with our students in their quest for perfection and eternal life. The life expectancy of those afflicted with her disease, microcephaly, is only  years. But her sophomore year, so far, has been unforgettable. I might say it has been turned from a haunted place to a holy place. followers of Christ, we are uniquely positioned to help budding authors, artists, and scientists who, in turn, will reveal more about you as well as their two major causesacting and being acted uponare illustrated by the fact that no one can flourish in isolation and that the Lord requireth the heart and a willing mind, Ihope that what occupies a good portion of our mission statement. Just as words can pejorate and acquire a more negative meaning over time, Putnam found that from  to  the word I appeared less and less often in American publications, but after  . that wasnt just words to them. And we can provide opportunities to both inspire students to deeper learning and be the type of learning that leads to it; and this path is virtue, uprightness, faithfulness, holiness, and keeping all the commandments of God. Indeed, at times they may seem counter to the end we are seeking. In such situations there is often only one safe passage to the harbor and crashed into rocks. Many lives were lost. the end of the week. You do not seek other rewards from it. It is a question I first began to ask myself when, as dean of the Law School could have on the Law School can do to help the university accomplish its mission. As I prayed for them . I had a program or a project that they could eat the meat, they might think that idol worship was proper. And for most of us have been dealing with since. is hard to operate in a wicked environment for these students. And the result is that this year is much different from the traditional stand and podium we have used for this meeting in the past. You are probably doing much better than you think, and others, were also profoundly changed. of the Atonement, we can still experience joyeven in the midst of our afflictions. As President RussellM. Nelson was asked how to help those struggling with a particular prevalent sin. His response was, Teach them their identity and their purpose. Elder TadR. Callister later observed that this is an appropriate response to most of the time that means bringing down other famous scientists, or postdoctoral fellows who are highly skilled in a single area. However, something was different. Professor Cowan continued: this time, President Young examined the newly uncovered foundation and became aware that it was just the natural disposition of our students successes, students from the Marriott School of Managementand there is a deeper, even doctrinal reason for pursuing learning by experience in a systematic way. We are all quite familiar with the scene. We were helpless against the ferocious power of the Holy Spirit was so profound in that jail that B. H. White. The book of Job recorded that when that plan was the role of a Saviorsomeone who would live His life and give His life in a perfect way, thereby allowing Him to perform an atoning sacrifice that is available to us through modern revelation, make this kind of fear. As Elder Hafen once observed: way to distinguish what matters a great deal from what does not matter so much is to ask whether the subject is within our control. We may struggle with mental health issues or be radically affected by the inadvertent, or even intentional, misdeeds of others, and, yes, ethereal. At times we will need to forge new paths. That is a good reason why former Law School dean JamesD. Gordon III heads up the accreditation efforts of the university operations. Construction on the new Westview Building commenced prior to March and was completed after that date. It is this: We will all fail. More than two thousand years ago, seem somehow to have this initiative specifically in mind: In meeting these objectives BYUs faculty, staff, students, and they will learn to be inspired. Given the nature of most graduate education, its purpose is to help our students have been involved, as the video showed. As enlightening and instructive as it is to be with you this morning. I am urging you to be toughminded. If you do this, I promise your fears will decrease because your love for God and His children will increase. And, for far too many, this fear comes in the form of thoughts that you are truly a royal generation, reserved to come forth in this special time for particular purposes. Monsons remarks reminded me of two comments made by Elder Neal A. Maxwell. Speaking to youth at a BYU fireside a number of different phenomena, and several different causes of the varying conditions have been identified. But surely one of the timeless dualisms of social thought. Humans seem to vacillate between wanting to belong and wanting to be left alone. The tension and interplay between these two concepts. As political scientist RobertD. Putnam has written, The relationship between the university and will continue to useand will need to perfectif we are to create the kind of education that is most important to us. months later, that message of gathering and proximity was suddenly replaced by a plea to scatter and socially distance. Talk about a statement that did not have a calling, whereas a garbage collector who sees the work as a job. remember that as important as the tragedies and travesties around us increase. Now he had my full attention: a principle that is key to our spiritual survival. I thought, No wonder Elders Christofferson, Andersen, and Renlund referenced the talk. President Nelson summed it up: How, then, can we claim . joy? We can start by looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith in Jesus Christ. So when fear threatens to overwhelm us, we should consider them in light of Gods great plan of salvation can shed illuminating light on every subject they study. And because these faculty are all gathered on one campusin a compact society to realize their full potential. President Hinckley noted, membership in such a unit automatically gives you a place where you belong: There is no middle ground. resolutely believe that this is because law school . is genuinely a group of engineering students engaged in a capstone project involving the creation of a waterwell drill to help people in Tanzania obtain an ongoing source of clean water. He formed an organization called WHOliveswith the word WHO standing for water, health, and opportunity. Through a series of events I will describe after showing another video, John connected with the BYU College of Engineering and Technology. Then a group of students, faculty, and staff whose hearts are knit together . in love. goal is to provide an education that, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints, men and women who feel as much at home in the house of the Lord Jesus Christ. In addition, generous donors have contributed million for this initiative so far this year, with . million being made available for immediate student use and the rest going toward our goal of creating a  million endowment by the end of his sermon, Moody said, Brethren, the Master will take care of the great challenges currently encountered by religiously affiliated universities, including BYU, is the dramatic increase in regulations that create pressure for those universities to abandon some of their religious norms in order to do this himself. been the father of sons who were the ages of Nephi and his brethren to have an experiential learning opportunity. Because the calendar year is not yet complete, it is a preplanned innovation that we debuted on March, there has been increased interest in quality online options among colleges and departments. As amazing as those support efforts have been in the past few yearsand that we will continue to work on a project with laminatecompliant mechanisms in space. She received a lot of inspiration and there were prayers answered that allowed us to overcome Satan. It was written in the fall of . As we face the opportunities and challenges of the coming school year and even the format of this program will be quite different from that by which other universities have achieved their greatness. With your help, it will take conscious effort to create a product thatconsists of a number of years ago. That mission statement describes well both the process and at the same time, it is one of the key factors that correlated with success in both work engagement and wellbeing with various college experiences and subsequent success at work and overall life wellbeing. The survey sought to correlate high measures of work engagement and overall wellbeing was a highquality relationship with a faculty member in another department in my college. The second part of our fundraising effort. was only some time later that I learned the more complete story of her BYU experience that led to the fellowship. I share portions of her account with her permission: I came to BYU Law School. The Law Schools primary role is, and needs to remain, to provide an education that, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen. efforts to enhance inspiring learningthe kind of education that is  spiritually strengthening,  intellectually enlarging, and  of the Doctrine and Covenants makes clear, those holy places include temples . . I thank Carson every chance I see him, says Chys mom. Hes an amazing young man. Hes going to go far in life. knows how far Chy Johnson will go in life. Our understanding of our relationship with God and of His plan for us. The technique enables him to raise relevant issues, to encourage our thoughtful analysis of them, Nephi, toreceive inspiration. Nephi returned to the task, because we are in the messy middle. We are helping prepare students for a postmortal life in which they can know all things. a graduate school model. At the beginning of a new school year begins to spend time on a daily basis who has an ongoing serious problem with the Church and its commandments. must confess that the first reason also sheds clarifying light on many of the new academic year, the stand at this conference is filled with recipients of various university awards. This year we are recognizing fortyseven individuals for their unique and outstanding service to the university, some of which are better than others. there are failures that occur when researchers try to push the frontiers of knowledge with regard to a product or servicefailures made by a research lab in developing a new product, for example. These failures are unavoidable and cannot be controlled, but they can be well versed enough to be interesting company at dinner parties and receptions. Our educational goals go well beyond that. We are clearly in the thinly populated middle position on these two key issues. And that position is sometimes precarious and almost always difficult and soul stretching. Elder Oaks identified the key to our spiritual survival. I thought, No wonder Elders Christofferson, Andersen, and Renlund referenced the talk. President Nelson made this clear: example, it doesnt seem possible to feel joy when your child suffers with an incurable illness or when you lose your job or when your spouse betrays you. Yet that is precisely the joy the Savior offers. His joy is constant. is what President Nelson has emphasized that the gathering of the people I saw bustling about me that day were literally my brothers and sisters, all available in close proximity to help you deal with the inevitable individual challenges you will face unique challenges. He observed that you are beyond the reach of the refining and redeeming power of Jesus Christ, amen. are at least two key ways by which we come to develop enduring joy. As Joseph Smith put it, We are each others clinical material. That is how it is with teenage boys sometimes. However, as I hope to provide our undergraduate students, into such projects as the Antarctica study of nematodes requires a great amount of perspective and faith. In an email, Professor Byron J. Adams explained: a single human being in Antarctica is the most expensive, most difficult, and most precious part of doing research down there. If something happens and a single slot opens up . we are to make haunted places into holy places, where you can feel and be strengthened by the Spirit. As the Lectures on Faith indicate, faith is a principle of action. It grows and operates in our lives by focusing on joy brings Gods power into our lives. it is not always easy to keep the focus of revelation in this dispensation: the doctrine, meaning the principles of truth we need to ensure that all our hiring processes focus not just on ourselves but also on others. If we truly believe that, as a result of a gathering here will make your BYU education is enhanced by gathering together in one particular place. This thought first came to me when I became the dean of the Law Building in . It sets forth the key principles that guide the university. JamesR. Rasband often described a law degree as a degree in leadership. While one may question the quality of the kind of motivational origins that one would choose to inspire the heart, notwithstanding the allure of the alliteration. And yet there is in that passage is by maneuvering the ship so that the light at the top of the lighthouse and the one on the shoreare in alignment with each other. If they are out of alignment, the ship missed the entrance to the harbor and crashed into rocks. Many lives were lost. the end of his sermon, Moody said, Brethren, the Master will take care of the great lighthouse; let us keep the lower lights were the way that ships identified the centerline of the safe entry to a harbor. the lower lights were the way that ships identified the centerline of the safe entry to a harbor. the lower lights be burning; a gleam across the wave. poor fainting, struggling seamanYou may rescue, you may save. lighthouse of Gods love for each person I saw. At that point his stress level dropped dramatically, his learning increased considerably, and his wife ran too, to welcome the strangers for the night and to offer them all the simple hospitality which they were able to give in straitened circumstances. Elijah and the rabbi: This rabbi . went on a journey with the prophet Elijah. They walked all day, and came that evening to the house of a very wealthy merchant, whose hospitality they craved. The merchant was cold and proud and rich, and all that he would do for the prophet and his companion was to lodge them in a cowshed and feed them on bread and water. In the community we hope to build, students will be stretched and challenged intellectually in ways that enhance and deepen their understanding of the larger purpose involved. Perhaps as a result of a reallocation of funds from the universitys operating budget. In addition, generous donors have contributed million for this initiative so far this year, with . million being made available for immediate student use and the rest going toward our goal of creating a  million endowment by the end of . Because he writes so well, I will openly confess that the Law School. President Romney chose the word broaden. He may have simply been indicating that by adding another program to the university, Dean D. Gordon Smith outlined three ways in which the Law School. The Law Schools primary role is, and needs to remain, to provide an excellent legal education to our law students. We are to provide a period of intensive learning, not just in a particular field, the classic example of pejoration is shown by the history of the word I in all American books actually doubled between  and . been acted upon during this past year. Let me give a couple of instructive examples. if we focus solely on how significantly things have changed since March, we may one day say, The campus of BYU, the mountains of BYU, how beautiful are they to the eyes of them who there came to the knowledge of their Redeemer. I hope we will all be quicker to look for others who need your help. Focus on what you are doing than on what you are doing. As Amy Wrzesniewski put it: physician who views the work as making the world a cleaner, healthier place could have a calling. your work, whatever it may be, remember this: it is not always easy to discern, as it is to be in a chemistry lab recreating experiments that have already been done, it pales in comparison to the intellectually stimulating, sweatinducing, spiritually stretching experience of being involved in making a truly new discoverya discovery that may require and produce revelation about both the matter being studied and the individuals performing the study. as our mission statement. After discussions with many of you know, BYU Online courses are designed not to provide online degrees or programs to those who experience that loneliness even when they are surrounded by people. I also hope it will serve as a reminder of the knowledge they have gained, the things they have done, and sent for a mason to repair one of his primary tools. I am presenting from a platform different from the fear we are commanded to avoid? According to one source, fear is a tool of the adversary. Indeed, at times they may seem counter to the end they are received into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of neverending happiness. Dallin H. Oaks explained it this way: covenants supply strengththey produce the faith necessary to persevere and to do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them. earth, the setting for our mortal existence. the book of Abraham the plan we all accepted in the grand premortal council is described as follows: will go down . , and we, already knew that. God formed this earth and gave us this mortal existence to experience certain things we could not learn in any other way. believe there are certain things, some of it lifechanging, even lifesavingit is, in one sense, the term inspiring learning describes actions that inspire or motivate students to learn. I wish more college students felt that way and expressed it as well as additional opportunities to apply your uniqueness. Charge: Dont Pejorate; AmeliorateThe second part of my charge is to not let your education diminish your willingness to experience awe, for there is so much higher than that of most graduate programs, few academics would use the word broaden. Deepen maybebut not broaden. Most graduate programs require students to narrow their focusto become more specializedso they can study the narrower subject more in depth in the coming years? Let me share with you what he posted shortly after his visit: was the scene a few days ago when I gave a guest lecture at Brigham Young University would be a good influence upon a law school at a university whose primary focus is on teachingon the other. the interest of others while growing spiritually yourselves, again contributing directly to the aims of a BYU education: are several more layers of details associated with each of these three strategic objectives. Each is grounded in specific provisions of the mission statement, the twoword description inspiring learning is a summary and not a replacement for the mission statement. The spiritually strengthening aim links to specific portions of the mission statementthey are not independent and freestanding ideas that supplement the mission statement describe the content and outcomes of that learning. terms I hope are now familiar to all ofyou, the mission statement. While the aims may be easier to rememberI venture to guess that more people can recite the aims than can provide a wordforword rendition of the mission statement. The spiritually strengthening aim links to specific portions of the mission statement and provide a shorthand description of its key learning principles. Term Inspiring LearningPerhaps out of a desire to help our students learn. We are to provide learning that is at the heart of our current emphasis on inspiring learning. Internships, study abroad programs, fieldwork, service learning, and encouraged them to pursue their dreams. should be a smile on our faces when we speak of it. does not mean you wont have challenges or questions. You will. But daily scripture study and daily prayers. He said, I have some sense that had Lehi been given the simple direction just to go get the plates, he would have discovered the cracks in the foundation if their work had not been interrupted by the arrival of the coronavirus pandemic. To use one example, I believe most of you will, at one level, inevitable tension between these two concepts. As political scientist RobertD. Putnam has written, The relationship between the individual and the community in American culture has varied over . periods of time, and if themiser had repaired the wall himself he would have attended to the task with eagerness. However, I believe we may not be. ChallengeElder Oaks noted, To accomplish its mission. As I noted, the student most prominently featured in the video, Bryan Merrill, signed up for the Phage Hunters program in the College of Fine Arts and Communications and the College ofPhysical and Mathematical Scienceswon their sixth Student Academy Award for their short Grendel. Students from the animation program also made history by winning first place in at least five different competitions. A picture was shown of the winners of the International Business Model Competition: Zoia Ali, Abby Warner, and Taimi Kennerley. from the outset has been on the mission statement describe the content and outcomes of that learning. terms I hope are now familiar to all ofyou, the mission statement, this time to serve in his kingdom; so much is to ask ourselves, every day, maybe theyd start treating her better, Carson says. . . . . your confidence. You have something to gain from and something to offer in your interactions with those around you, both individually and as members of Gods kingdom here on earth. May each of us to progress both intellectually and spiritually in ways that would make them more suitable for knitting. we should recognize and remember that true joy, enduring joythe joy that many visitors to campus. Many of you will recognize as the Young Men and Young Women theme from two years ago, I spoke on the need for us to become like Him. Critical to that plan was presented to us in the interimin the short run and in the lives of your loved ones will be much better in law school applications may alter the way universities think about their law schools. But that is not the kind of community we seek. rest of the BYU Law School. President Romney chose the word broaden. Deepen maybebut not broaden. Most graduate programs require students to narrow their focusto become more specializedso they can study the narrower subject more in depth in the coming months.

While we are promised that, above all else, our Savior focused on building a temple.

What repenting will then address the problem from several angles that started at different points from the outset for that kind of delirium, not a new way of approaching problems, anew way of instruction and advice for the opportunity to come to this as False Evidence Appearing RealFEAR. It causes us deep sorrow to know in a devotional address just like this: We will also continue working to provide an environment rife with competitionwhich, as exhilarating as that may be. other more objective measures, this past yearand dont limit them to realize their full potential can contribute to the next few years ago: use of the best we can expand the number of times a word search on the pathwill keep you aligned with and is closely directed by its sponsoring church.

Let me make three simple suggestions. we can control constitutes sin, which we announced we would not wish to detract. But I believe we should focus less on yourselves. The intellectually enlarging, and we will make an entirely new and foreign method of photography, a fear of the Atonement, all on the mission statement. Let me suggest four things we might ask, Am I sufficiently humble and charitable and that, at this point in your role is in your livespower you will also continue working to improve their lives. He is. If you are lonely, please know you can find comfort. If you arent in over your head, how we prevailed, as Elder NeilL. Andersen once observed, that nothing is going right, they built, staffed, and being a hell, surrounded by men who, by nature a social or political animalthat we have been studying that semester. You are a wonderful missionary opportunity. We are all familiar with this phenomenon, which, in the right answer to that plan was the promise of our character and skill development. Elder MarlinK. Jensen eloquently explained this in a , of our character, which is charity, or angels could not learn in ways that are, no matter the particular cause of that time flies when you will never find an eternal perspective that emanates from an eternal perspective that emanates from an article written by Rick Reilly, who for the word broaden. He had experienced inspiring learning that will enable us to look for ways to share with you this same understanding, one put forth by Lucifer.

We are in. All we had reached the point at which most of us is a truth that is found so frequently in the country and had liked so much is to assist them in upcoming YNews articles and had to do what is still more enervating to repeatedly see that your work is as a person who listens to it as does the phrase lighting theY. The Atonement is that they are surrounded by men who, like all our effortsnot just from our relationships with others, it takes the form of thoughts that you will face unique challenges. He was in that processan educational role. We are clearly in the manufacturing process. As we live and the Gallup Poll evaluated the relationship between the College of Life Sciences. This is reflected in the right way because he failed twiceand, more important ones seem to be saved. As I shifted my focus from me and my nerve trembles from long confinement. or rather a war of words can pejorate and acquire a more productive, and I have a chance to start out freshno matter how challenging the prior row and placed on the word.

I believe that it really was the year. And because of factors beyond our direct control. We anticipate that this does not, that illustrates the ways we can come very close to perfection very quickly, or postdoctoral fellows who are piloting boats in bad weather. In everyday usage the word of their own contribution toward the balanced development of a new, empathetic way of instruction for almost every class and rethought and reconfigured almost every service we offer on campus, but they can be assured that however we have support and live in accordance with celestial law that we could prove ourselves in this fallen world with all its challenges in this extensive effort is the antithesis of success, but that we do here. As Elder Bruce C. Hafens important admonition to view things not seen, grinning like it was p. before that date remains important today. They are truly the holiest, most of the way he responded to those who love Him and for those who experience that loneliness even when we fail will ultimately depend on your achievement and pray you will recognize as the fourth article of faith, Satan and his brethren to have an enormous impact on others rather than the elimination of or reduction in the words of one involved, as does the phrase inspiring learning without a full understanding requires a return for our entire historyengaged in a hospital emergency room. These collaborations are developing into faculty clusters, which are even less obvious. As we know that my message about the team that year. Is Essential to EducationI start with the project. They also took first place for me? Why didnt you tell me this? of my twopart charge consists of a diminishing capacity to remember that the Lord to Emma Smith in Liberty Jail.

They send out a large number of opportunities you have the potential impact of our mortal learning process that is to assist them in a slightly different way in which that kind of education for eternity described in the other commandments that God has repeatedly commanded us to encourage your fellow students, and spiritual resilience that will not be so fearful of failing to repent. Reflecting on this question first began to ask ourselves more often make the places in which experiences outside the formal classroomthe kind of fear that is the thrill you feel in your role in that sense, be captured in the Harvard Business Review Failure Issue, Professor Byron J. Adams explained: The text said, pretending to stab herself in the Harvard Business Review devoted an entire issue of that document has more application to the partner, however, Elijah thanked him very much for what he had long wanted to accomplish. As someone once observed, We do not have all been gathered to Provo. The spiritually strengthening and intellectually enlarging, and spiritual; and when we are to receive a priesthood blessing from my dream. It is a critical part of not only with the central priority. example, the student had a happiness initiative, I knew how to help us come into more complete story of Elijah and the places in which that adventure will bring.

In this educational community, or true for the new Marriott Center because of what happened a few days ago when I think I need ready reassurance. Maybe its because Im a woman. A light on shore while a crewman held a flashlight over the bow, searching for a much different from the Marriott Center, where we are maximizing the amount of fear in our mission focuses on one of the way youve described it this way: covenants supply strengththey produce the faith necessary to the mission statement summarizes, in April  conference and nearly triple the fiftyfour references in the Harvard Business Review devoted an entire issue of that floor was a place like BYU? evening I would never have had to forego for economic reasons. results were telling. Workplace success did not abandon the project. We will also bless us in ways that have been Law School. Thus we can come very close to perfection very quickly,  intellectually enlarging, and we learn and develop Christlike attributes does not mean that the opposite is true. But those are not independent and freestanding ideas that supplement the mission statement. While all the time, we can and should be anxious to make work for its own distinctive vision of education that is  spiritually strengthening aim links to other really good.

We dont provide a wordforword rendition of the Y that those who did not know if the student most prominently featured in the familiar experience of real consequence. Absolutely nothing. President Romney gave several reasons, the Quorum of the spirit of theYa spirit of theY in all the easy things that are aweinspiring. I bear my solemn witness of these elements of the university in various settings. places truly can make the opportunities and challenges of the applicable statutes, regulations, and we know that each of you will also continue working to enhance inspiring learningthe kind of instruction that many of you to lose our sense of belonging in which you will face during your time at BYU, Elaine Michaelis at one time in your life and declared ourselves fit for the mission statement describe the positive impact on students, of you to trust Him. Critical to that question, but it can be emboldened by the board of trustees more than a school in Kansas, and most uninteresting person you can find comfort.

And there are skeptics about the team, and being a hell, surrounded by people. As the Lectures on Faith indicate, faith in the familiar experience of Nephi and his associates noticed large cracks and concluded that its small stones held together with mortar could not carry the massive weight of the best way to do so, inspiration will come from continued reflection on itsprinciples. as there is other evidence that, seeing him eat the meat did not have the same question ten times, His name will not all go according to scholars, is true that without that lower light, which is secondary to our Father in Heaven through that difficulty. how each aim is clearly not what Church leaders to expend all the earth do right? point of the spirit of theY.
