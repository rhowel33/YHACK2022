Because of the Atonement, all failures are changeable and temporary, except the one that occurs when we give up. So whatever you do, don’t you dare give up. This is my first opportunity to address you in a devotional as president of the university. Let me begin by telling you, “You look really good.” That is different from being good-looking, though you are that as well. I hope that each of you has some inkling of the spirit you carry with you and the light that radiates from you. It is evident to visitors to the campus—who sometimes struggle to come up with words to describe what they see and feel in your presence. I thank each of you for your individual contribution to what is the real Spirit of the Y that those who come on campus experience so profoundly. It truly is an honor to be your president. Those who have heard me speak these past few months will not be surprised that I begin by quoting a portion of the BYU mission statement, which was approved and adopted by the board of trustees more than thirty years ago. That mission statement describes well both the process and the anticipated results of a BYU education. I urge each of you to read and ponder it, as well as the BYU Aims, as this new year begins. The most familiar line of that mission statement summarizes, in general terms, the details that follow. “The mission of Brigham Young University,” it states, “is to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life.”1 My remarks today focus on one reality about that quest for perfection. It is a truth that is hard to deny, yet difficult to accept. It is this: We will all fail. More than once. Every day. I know that may sound startling and not the most optimistic of messages, so let me be quick to add that this does not mean that you or I are failures or that the quest for perfection is futile. There is a difference between failing, even repeatedly, and being a failure, as I hope to explain. Failing is an essential part of the mortal phase of our quest for perfection. We don’t often think of it that way, but that is only because we tend to focus too much on the word perfection and not enough on the word quest when we read the mission statement. Failure is an inevitable part of the quest. In our quest for perfection, how we respond when we fail will ultimately determine how well we will succeed. My plea for you today is to learn how to fail successfully. To help you in that regard, let me provide a little broader context for the quest for perfection and the role that failure plays in that process. The primary purpose of our mortal existence is to help us become like our heavenly parents. One of the things we need to do in order to accomplish that purpose is to learn and apply truth in our lives. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that “it is impossible for a man to be saved in ignorance”2 and that “a man is saved no faster than he gets knowledge.”3 Thus learning is an essential part of not only our BYU experience but also this mortal phase of our quest for perfection. The scriptures teach that there are three main ways we can learn: one, by study;4 two, by faith;5 and, three, by experience.6 A lot has been written and spoken at BYU about how we learn by study and by faith,7 but we talk much less about how we learn from experience. Yet learning from experience is one of the essential purposes of our mortal existence. In the book of Abraham the plan we all accepted in the grand premortal council is described as follows: We will go down . . . , and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell; And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them.8 This earth, the setting for our mortal existence, was created so that we could “prove” ourselves. But I believe we may not appreciate the full meaning of the word prove in that scripture. In everyday usage the word prove means to demonstrate something that already exists.9 Thus we take final exams to prove what we already know about the material we have been studying that semester. But the Oxford English Dictionary provides an additional meaning for the word prove. It indicates that prove also means “to find out, learn, or know by experience.”10 I believe the opportunity we have to prove ourselves in this life was not designed to allow us to demonstrate to God how obedient we already were before we came to earth. He, and we, already knew that. God formed this earth and gave us this mortal existence so that we could “prove” ourselves in the other sense of that word—so that we could “find out, learn, or know by experience” truths that we did not already know and that we could not learn in any other way. I believe there are certain things, some of them essential to our exaltation, that we can learn only through experience. We could not have remained in our premortal condition, memorized all the attributes of godhood, and then, after passing a written exam, become like our heavenly parents. We came to earth to “prove” ourselves, to learn from our own experiences how to know good from evil and other important lessons we could learn only by our own experience. And one of the best ways we can fully learn those essential lessons is by failing in our efforts. Let me illustrate with a simple experience from my own professional life. Two years after I graduated from law school I found myself working on a tax law project for a partner in a law firm in Phoenix, Arizona. By that time I had not only finished law school but had completed judicial clerkships for two very good judges at two of the best courts in the country and had passed the bar exam. In my mind I knew how to be a lawyer. Even though I had not had any tax law experience before I received the assignment, I knew quite well where to begin looking for the answer to the question posed to me by the partner. After extensive research of the applicable statutes, regulations, and cases—and after revising several drafts—I confidently presented to the partner a memo that I felt answered his question. The partner quickly skimmed the memo, read the conclusion, and then confidently opined, “This can’t be the law.” I was quite taken aback and a little offended. “I’ve read the statutes, the regulations, and the cases,” I responded. “That’s what they say.” “I don’t care,” he retorted. “Tax law in this area can’t work the way you’ve described it. Go try again.” It was, to use the term my children often use to describe my less glorious moments, an “epic failure.” After further discussing the issue with the partner, I examined the problem from several angles that started at different points from the one at which I had first begun. Over time a different analysis appeared—one that changed the answer to the question in a subtle but important way. When I presented a revised memo to the partner with a more in-depth analysis and a different answer, he was satisfied. I asked him at that point whether he had known the answer to the question all along and was just trying to make work for me. “No,” he replied, “I really didn’t. I just know how these kinds of businesses work, and I have a pretty good feel for tax law. Your earlier approach just didn’t seem right.” I knew how to acquire abstract legal information; I even knew how to analyze that information in theoretical terms. The partner, however, knew how to be a lawyer—and there is a difference between those two things, just as there is a difference between knowing the attributes of God in an abstract sense and making those attributes a part of our character, which is what our quest for perfection requires. How do we learn that latter important skill? The partner helped me understand that as well. When I asked him what it was that allowed him to almost intuit the right answer to the problem, he replied, “It takes good judgment.” “And how do you acquire good judgment?” I asked. “Good judgment,” he said, “comes from experience.” Then, after pausing for just a few seconds and with only a hint of a smile, he added, “And experience comes from bad judgment.” In other words, from failing. As one motivational speaker observed: We always think of failure as the antithesis of success, but it isn’t. Success often lies just the other side of failure.11 The lesson is so prevalent in life that three years ago the Harvard Business Review devoted an entire issue of that publication to the topic of how to learn from failures. 12 We can see the same lesson in the familiar experience of Nephi when he was given the assignment to obtain the brass plates from Laban. As we know, his first two efforts failed, but he persisted and ultimately succeeded. In the process he discovered the power of being “led by the Spirit,” 13 a critical lesson that he may not have learned if the first effort to persuade Laban to release the plates had been successful. Nephi’s life was forever changed in a positive way because he failed twice—and, more important, because of the way he responded to those failures. Thus failing is a critical component of our eternal progress—our quest for perfection. And because of the Atonement we can—if we respond to failures in the right way—be blessed with a new kind of learning that allows our failures to become part of the perfecting process. As Elder Bruce C. Hafen has explained, the beauty of the gospel is that “because of the Atonement, we can learn from our mistakes without being condemned by them.”14 What a wonderful blessing that absolutely marvelous and indispensable portion of the plan of salvation provides to each of us, if we will but take advantage of it. This does not mean that we should try to fail as often as we can. “Not all failures are created equal.”15 In one of the articles in the Harvard Business Review Failure Issue, Professor Amy C. Edmondson noted that in business there are three main kinds of failures, some of which are better than others. First, there are failures that result from the lack of precision in routine but important matters—for example, a failure to follow design specifications in the manufacturing process. According to Professor Edmondson, these are “bad” failures that are preventable and should be eliminated as quickly as possible. Second, there are failures that are the inevitable results of complexity in processes—mistakes made in uncontrollable situations, such as in triage in a hospital emergency room. These failures are unavoidable and cannot be controlled, but they can be managed. Finally, there are failures that occur when researchers try to push the frontiers of knowledge with regard to a product or service—failures made by a research lab in developing a new product, for example. These failures can be “good” failures if structured in the right way because they can accelerate the learning process.16 If we are to fail successfully—if failure is to move us along in our quest for perfection—we need to make similar distinctions in our daily efforts and daily failures. In our own personal lives, willful failure in important, routine things we can control constitutes sin, which we should avoid as much as possible. In things that are routine but essential to our eternal progress—things like daily prayer, daily scripture study, and regular church attendance—we should strive to eliminate all failings. In these matters we can come very close to perfection very quickly, and it is important that we do so, because success in these endeavors provides the secure foundation that allows us to deal effectively with the other two kinds of failure. When determining what things fall into this first category of failure, we might profitably ask ourselves two questions: One, are these things entirely within our control? And, two, are they things that in the long run really matter? There is a correlation between affirmative answers to those two questions. As Elder Hafen once observed: One way to distinguish what matters a great deal from what does not matter so much is to ask whether the subject is within our control. If it is, then it probably matters enough to merit our attention. But if the subject of our fretting is inherently beyond our control, it is not likely that God will hold us responsible for our ultimate success or failure as to that concern.17 At the other end of Professor Edmondson’s failure spectrum—“good failures” resulting from efforts to extend the frontiers of our knowledge—we should not be so fearful of failing that we avoid trying new or hard things merely because their very newness or difficulty increases the risk of failure. Don’t let concern for protecting your grade point average dictate the courses you take. Challenge yourself, academically and in other ways. You may discover skills, talents, and joys you would otherwise miss out on. Your mortal experience will be a more productive part of your quest for perfection if you intentionally stretch yourself with new challenges, especially those that involve a real risk of failure. As someone once observed, “If you aren’t in over your head, how do you know how tall you are?”18 Maybe our most difficult challenge is to deal with the second category of failures—those that are not willful sin or intentional calculated risks but rather the unavoidable, uncontrollable failures that occur because of the messiness of life, because of factors beyond our direct control. What do you do when, for the first time in your life, you get an A− or a B or a D, even though you have worked very hard? Or when you try your best but you still don’t make the Women’s Chorus? Or when the relationship you are pursuing falls apart? Or even when all these things and more important ones seem to go wrong at the same time and you feel completely alone, overwhelmed, and totally a failure? What do you do then? Let me suggest you follow the advice given in Hebrews 10:35: “Cast not away . . . your confidence.” You have not arrived at this point in your lives without having accomplished much, as Peggy has just explained. I know you may sometimes feel like the least intelligent, least talented, and most socially awkward student who has ever set foot on this campus, but you were not admitted to this university on a whim. The process is better than that. And you are better than that. More important, you have the potential to be much better than that. Remembering what you have already accomplished and understanding your full potential can contribute to the development of the kind of emotional, physical, mental, and spiritual resilience that will allow you, in the words of the BYU mission statement, to meet “personal challenge and change.”19 Professor Martin E. P. Seligman, one of the founders of positive psychology, has observed that the most common characteristic of those who are able to overcome almost any kind of uncontrollable failure is that they are optimistic.20 And the good news is that people can be taught to some degree “to think like optimists.”21 One way Professor Seligman suggests is by helping people view setbacks as things that are “[1] temporary, [2] local, and [3] changeable.”22 In other words, they react to failures by thinking, “[1] It’s going away quickly, [2] it’s just this one situation, and [3] I can do something about it.”23 That process, studies have shown, is aided by recalling past successes24 and recognizing individual strengths that we have.25 Eternal gospel truths, available to us through modern revelation, make this kind of optimistic thinking even easier. For example, we know that each of us “is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents, and, as such, each has a divine nature and destiny.”26 Thus we have much greater strengths and talents than we realize. Moreover, we are promised that, from an eternal perspective, our “adversity and . . . afflictions shall be but a small moment.”27 Thus we can be certain that whatever we are going through will be temporary. Finally, we can be assured that however we have failed, it can, from an eternal perspective, be changed. The Atonement is that powerful and that comprehensive. As Elder Jeffrey R. Holland put it: If you are lonely, please know you can find comfort. If you are discouraged, please know you can find hope. . . . If you feel you are broken, please know you can be mended.28 Because of the Atonement, all failures are changeable and temporary, except the one that occurs when we give up. So whatever you do, don’t you dare give up. What I am suggesting is not simply an affirmation of the power of positive thinking; it is a recognition of the power of the gospel of Jesus Christ—the perspective it gives us, the truths it provides, and “the infinite virtue of [Christ’s] atoning sacrifice”29 that is available to us all. Yes, I am asking you to trust yourself more, but, more important, I am asking you to trust God. I urge you—in your moments of doubt and despair, in the times when you think you have failed and you think you can’t make it right—to focus more on Him and less on yourselves. Too often we ask the wrong question when we fail. We ask, “Am I good enough?” But the real question is, “Is God good enough?” Is He as good as He says He is? Can He really deliver on His promise that “all things” will “work together for [our] good”30 if we will trust Him and strive to do the best we can and keep going whenever we fall short? I testify that He is. God is as good, as powerful, as loving, as patient, and as consistent as He says He is. If we will but focus on the eternal truths He has made available to us, both through institutional revelation and through personal promptings and reassurances, He will turn all our failures into successes. I bear my witness that He lives and loves us with a love we cannot comprehend. He gave His Son so that we might move forward in our quest for perfection with full confidence and assurance that we will succeed despite our failures. I bear my solemn witness of these truths and express my love and God’s love for each of you, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen. <start> Our efforts to enhance inspiring learning—the kind of education for eternity described in our mission statement—can have an enormous impact on all of our students. But it need not and should not end there. It is a joy to be with you this morning. There is something about the beginning of a new school year that brings hope and optimism. Perhaps it is the chance to start out fresh—no matter how challenging the prior semester has been. Perhaps it is the promise that fall, with its crisp air and changing leaves—and, for me, football season—will soon arrive. Hopefully for all of us it is the thrill you feel in being involved in the intellect-expanding, soul-­refining, celestializing endeavor in which we are all engaged. This last year has brought many successes and a few challenges. Since we last met in this setting, more than 7,700 of our students graduated and moved on to the next phase of their lifelong learning process. During their stay here, many accomplished great things, ranging from receiving a Truman Scholarship to temple marriage. Others excelled as they represented the university in various settings. The BYU Ballroom Dance Company won the Blackpool competition in modern formation, a feat they have accomplished every time since 1989 that their three-year cycle has taken them back to England. They also took first place in Latin American formation—another repeat championship. The men’s volleyball team, the men’s rugby team, and the women’s rugby team all competed in their respective national championship games, all on the same day. Hopefully you can identify and celebrate other successes in your areas. They are evident all around us. Improvements have also been made to our campus infrastructure. We completed fund-raising for the new Engineering Building, and construction is now underway. Expansion of the Harman Building has begun, in large part to expand the online learning environment here on campus, and the new Marriott Center Annex, housing our men’s and women’s basketball teams, is nearing completion. My thanks to all those involved in these and numerous other projects on campus. We have also faced challenges in this past year—challenges that give us opportunities to improve. As I am sure you are all aware, we are examining in depth the reporting process for our students and other aspects of the way we handle sexual assault cases. It causes us deep sorrow to know that members of our community would be victimized in such a devastating way. We are anxious to help them. A group of faculty and administrators have worked tirelessly during the summer to help us know how best to do that. We anticipate that this fall the advisory council will present their recommendations to the President’s Council. We will then address the topic with the campus community more in depth. In the meantime, let me emphasize that the top priority in this extensive effort is the safety and well-being of our students, especially those who have been the victims of sexual assault. Efforts will continue until sexual assault is eliminated from our campus environment. Learning at Brigham Young University I think by now you know me well enough to correctly predict that my message today will somehow focus on the mission statement. I continue to be impressed with how the language in this three-decade-old document sheds clarifying light on many of the new situations, new challenges, and new opportunities we encounter. I believe there was inspiration in the creation of that document and that inspiration will come from continued reflection on its principles. So, as we reflect on this year’s conference theme, which reminds us that “the Lord requireth the heart and a willing mind,”1 I hope that what occupies a good portion of our hearts and minds is the role we are to play in assisting our students “in their quest for perfection and eternal life.”2 The mission statement makes it clear that our primary role in that process is to help our students learn. We are to provide them “a period of intensive learning.”3 That phrase describes the rigor of the learning experience our students should have. Other portions of the mission statement describe the content and outcomes of that learning. In terms I hope are now familiar to all of you, the mission statement indicates that, above all else, our students should learn “the truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ.”4 In addition, they should experience learning that is “broad”—learning that enables them to think clearly, communicate effectively, understand important ideas in their own cultural tradition as well as that of others, and establish clear standards of intellectual integrity.5 Our students should also experience learning “in the special fields of their choice”— learning that will enable them to compete “with the best in their fields.”6 In addition, they should experience learning that renders them not only . . . capable of meeting personal challenge and change but . . . also [of bringing] strength to others in the tasks of home and family life, social relationships, civic duty, and service to mankind.7 The Aims document effectively boils all these down to four main points: we are to provide learning that is “(1) spiritually strengthening, (2) intellectually enlarging, and (3) character building, leading to (4) lifelong learning and service.”8 Notice how each aim is directly connected to specific portions of the mission statement. The spiritually strengthening aim links to specific portions of the mission statement. The intellectually enlarging aim links to other portions, as does the character building aim. Other sections of the mission statement explain the lifelong learning and service aim. And there are even more links. These convey the truth that one cannot fully understand the aims unless one fully understands the mission statement. While the aims may be easier to remember—I venture to guess that more people can recite the aims than can provide a word-for-word rendition of the mission statement—they are not independent and freestanding ideas that supplement the mission statement. They derive directly from the mission statement and provide a shorthand description of its key learning principles. The Term “Inspiring Learning” Perhaps out of a desire to simplify things as much as possible—and perhaps as a result of a diminishing capacity to remember even four things—but largely in an effort to succinctly explain what we are about in a way that allows people to easily remember, I have tried to simplify the core learning goals even more while still emphasizing that a full understanding requires a return to the mission statement. After discussions with many of you in many settings, I have concluded that one two-word description that achieves that end is “inspiring learning.” Note again that one cannot understand the full meaning of the term “inspiring learning” without a full understanding of the mission statement. Just as the Aims document is a summary and not a replacement for the mission statement, the two-word description “inspiring learning” is a summary and not a replacement. Inspiring is an interesting word. It derives from the Latin term inspirare, which means “to breathe into” and, more specifically, “to breathe life into.”9 Inspiring is both a noun and an adjective. The noun can be defined as the act of inspiring or motivating. In this sense, the term “inspiring learning” describes actions that inspire or motivate students to learn. As an adjective, inspiring is a modifier. In this context it describes a kind of learning: learning that inspires—or, more precisely, in our setting, learning that leads to inspiration or revelation. When I use the term “inspiring learning,” I have in mind both meanings of the word inspiring. I hope we inspire our students to learn. And I hope that learning leads to inspiration. When both things happen, inspiring learning occurs, and we can then know we are on the right track to achieve the core goals set forth in our mission statement. While the term “inspiring learning” may not be familiar to you, my guess is that many of you are familiar with the phenomenon. Inspiring learning occurs in many of our classrooms for many of our students on a regular basis. Indeed, it may happen so often that we fail to appreciate how exhilarating it can be. We grow used to it. Sometimes it takes someone from outside the university to point it out to us. Here is one example. This past January, New York University professor of journalism Jay Rosen came to campus as a guest lecturer. Let me share with you what he posted shortly after his visit: This was the scene a few days ago when I gave a guest lecture at Brigham Young University, which of course is a Mormon school. . . . A most unusual thing happened before I was introduced. Unusual for me, normal at Brigham Young. Dale Cressman, who organized the event and guided me around campus, asked a student to begin the event with a prayer. The student stood and prayed for help in “feeling grateful for the opportunity to learn.” I wish more college students felt that way and expressed it as well as she did. I found the BYU students a joy to teach. They were extremely engaged. With good humor they tolerated me asking and reasking them the same question ten times, answering in a slightly different way each time, which allowed me to make a new point in response. After the talk, at least a dozen of them thanked me, and each one shook my hand, looked me in the eye, and made a personal connection. “Grateful for the opportunity to learn” . . . that wasn’t just words to them. It was one of the best experiences I have had in 30 years as a professor.10 That is an example of inspiring learning. And classrooms are the central places in which that kind of learning occurs. I hope we can make each of our classrooms a place of inspiring learning, a place in which students become excited about learning and in which that learning leads to revelation. Learning by Experience While it is essential that our formal classrooms be sites of inspiring learning, that by itself will not completely fulfill our mission. Let me return to the mission statement, this time to the second paragraph: All instruction, programs, and services at BYU, including a wide variety of extracurricular experiences, should make their own contribution toward the balanced development of the total person.11 Note “all instruction,” including “a wide variety of extracurricular experiences.” Some of the most important inspiring learning opportunities occur outside the formal classroom setting through experiences that are, in that sense, extracurricular. And, without implying either that we have fully perfected classroom instruction or that we are going to emphasize classroom instruction less, let me suggest that one way we can enhance the quality of inspiring learning at BYU is to expand both the quantity and quality of the kind of learning that occurs outside the formal ­classroom—the kind of instruction that many call “experiential learning.” Just like classroom learning, experiential learning can produce the kind of inspiring learning that our mission statement challenges us to provide. Experiential learning has become somewhat of a buzzword in academia in recent years. However, for us there is a deeper, even doctrinal reason for pursuing learning by experience in a systematic way. We are all quite familiar with the scriptural injunction that we “seek learning, even by study and also by faith.”12 That describes two key ways by which we learn important truths: by study and by faith. But those are not the only ways by which we learn essential knowledge and skills. Gospel teaching instructs us that we learn by study, we learn by faith, and we learn by experience. Learning by experience is a central purpose of our mortal journey. As Elder David A. Bednar once observed, “Learning by faith and from experience are two of the central features of the Father’s plan of happiness.”13 We could not have simply memorized celestial laws in our premortal life and declared ourselves fit for the celestial kingdom. We needed to come to this mortal existence to experience certain things we could not experience in our premortal life and to learn from those experiences. Experience is a key part of our mortal learning process. Similarly, students cannot learn all they need to learn by memorizing or even discussing principles in a classroom, as exhilarating as that may be. Experience connects theory with application and deepens our understanding of the principles and truths we learn. And, in my view, experiential learning can be inspiring learning in both senses of that term. It can both inspire students to deeper learning and be the type of learning that leads to inspiration. There is ample evidence that experiential learning can inspire and excite students to learn in ways that have a deep and long-lasting impact. Describing the results of his study about student learning at Harvard, Professor Richard J. Light observed: I assumed that most important and memorable academic learning goes on inside the classroom, while outside activities provide a useful but modest supplement. The evidence shows that the opposite is true. . . . When we asked students to think of a specific, critical incident or moment that had changed them profoundly, four-fifths of them chose a ­situation or event outside of the classroom.14 Likewise, in a 2008 study, George D. Kuh, the founding director of the widely used National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE), identified ten teaching and learning practices that have especially high impact on students. Five of those—including such things as internships, service learning, and undergraduate research—involved activities that would easily fit into the category of experiential learning.15 Other studies underscore the point. A 2014 survey of approximately 30,000 college students conducted by Purdue University and the Gallup Poll evaluated the relationship between various college experiences and subsequent success at work and overall life well-being. The survey sought to correlate high measures of work engagement and well-being with various college experiences. The results were telling. Workplace success did not correlate with the size of the university attended, large or small, or with whether the university was private or public. But other factors did seem to matter. Specifically, the study found that the chances that individuals would thrive at work—the highest measure of work ­engagement—doubled if during college they “had an internship or job where they were able to apply what they were learning in the classroom, were actively involved in extracurricular activities and organizations, and worked on projects that took a semester or more to complete.”16 The first two clearly involve experiential learning; the third may as well. Evidence from our own campus also illustrates the ways in which experiences outside the classroom can inspire students to learn. Let me cite as one example the Phage Hunters program in the College of Life Sciences. This program enlists students early on—sometimes as freshmen on their very first day of class—to begin original research. The students collect soil samples and for the next two semesters work to isolate and identify a bacteriophage that has never been seen before. One project involved students working under the direction of Professor Sandra Hope, who was searching for a viable way to treat a disease that affects honeybee hives. Notice in this video the involvement of the students. [A video presentation was shown.] As noted, the student most prominently featured in the video, Bryan Merrill, signed up for the Phage Hunters class as a sophomore. After completing the class, Bryan was hired as a TA and worked as a research assistant and mentor to other students in the class. By the time he graduated from BYU with his master’s degree in molecular biology, Bryan had already published (or copublished) eight research articles and had worked on twenty-three genome sequences. He is currently pursuing a doctoral degree in microbiology and immunology at Stanford University. Bryan’s initial experience with phages clearly inspired lifelong and career-enhancing learning. I believe such experiential learning activities can also help students learn to be inspired. Given the nature of the phenomenon being measured, there are no academic studies—at least none that I could find—that address the impact that experiential learning may have on a person’s ability to receive inspiration or revelation. But there is other evidence that, at this unique institution, is at least as persuasive. We are all familiar with the Book of Mormon account of Lehi’s sons going back to Jerusalem to obtain the plates of brass. In a sometimes overlooked portion of that account, Lehi noted three times that the Lord commanded him that he should send his sons back to get the plates,17 thereby making it clear that Lehi was not supposed to do this himself. Having been the father of sons who were the ages of Nephi and his brethren at the time, I have some sense that had Lehi been given the simple direction just to go get the plates, he would have attended to the task himself. It would have been simpler and easier. That is how it is with teenage boys sometimes. However, the Lord made it clear that Lehi was to send his sons. Why? I suggest that at least part of the reason is that the Lord wanted Nephi and his brethren to have an experiential learning opportunity. It may have been easier and faster for Lehi to get the plates himself, but God was not interested just in getting the plates. He was also interested—more interested—in helping Lehi’s sons in their quest for perfection and eternal life. And He furthered that process by providing those sons with a learning experience that caused at least one of them, Nephi, to receive inspiration. When Nephi returned to the camp after that learning experience, he came back not only with the plates but with a greater faith in God and a greater understanding of how inspiration comes. He had experienced inspiring learning. Nephi’s experience in obtaining the plates—or, more precisely, Lehi’s experience in facilitating that experience—demonstrates an important truth about the kind of inspiring learning that comes from experience. It requires that the teacher have great patience and a clear understanding of the larger purpose involved. Perhaps as a result of God’s commanding him multiple times that he should send his sons, Lehi came to realize that, as important as the plates were—and they were of great importance, as demonstrated by the fact that Nephi took Laban’s life to obtain them—securing their possession was not the main object of the experience. The main purpose was to refine Lehi’s children, who were also God’s children. Similarly, as important as our research may be—and some of it is of enormous importance, some of it life-changing, even lifesaving—it is, in the long run, not as important as the ­eternal development of our students. I applaud and admire the way so many of you pursue both these ends with full purpose of heart and mind, without sacrificing either. But it is hard work. Again, one illustration will stand as proxy for numerous others that might be provided. [A video presentation was shown.] Taking students, especially undergraduate students, into such projects as the Antarctica study of nematodes requires a great amount of perspective and faith. In an email, Professor Byron J. Adams explained: Supporting a single human being in Antarctica is the most expensive, most difficult, and most precious part of doing research down there. If something happens and a single slot opens up . . . , we have [to select] a person best suited to help with the project. . . . Most of the time that means bringing down other famous scientists, or postdoctoral fellows [who] are highly skilled in a single area. However, on several occasions I’ve been able to justify bringing students down because I can train them very well . . . on exactly what they need to do. And because my students have always been exceptionally awesome (hard working, skilled, fun to be around), my colleagues are happy to have them on the team. So far, six different students have accompanied Professor Adams to Antarctica, three of them undergraduates. This coming year he will take two other graduate students. And while there are risks, there are also enormous rewards. Professor Adams reported: The first undergrad I brought to Antarctica is now a faculty member in another department in my college. The second one is a faculty member at the University of California, Riverside. The third is just beginning his medical residency in OB/GYN. The first grad student I brought down is now a geneticist at a USDA research center; the rest are still in my program working toward graduation. Enhancing Inspiring Learning at BYU Inspiring learning requires faith both by the students and by the faculty member. It is not an easy task, but it is an inspiring one. So we might ask ourselves: What can we do to enhance the impact of these kinds of ­inspiring learning experiences at BYU in the coming year and in the coming years? Let me make three simple suggestions. First, we can expand the number of students who have a meaningful experiential ­learning opportunity. We can, for example, look for ways to provide more faculty mentoring opportunities for them. The impact of faculty mentoring can be enormous. In a report summarizing a large number of academic studies, clinical psychologist and professor of psychology W. Brad Johnson said: Compared to nonmentored individuals, those with mentors tend to be more satisfied with their careers, enjoy more promotions and higher income, report greater commitment to the organization or profession, and are more likely to mentor others in turn.18 The impact is even greater at a place like BYU, where we are interested in more than academic or temporal success. Because we challenge faculty members to be leaders in their fields of research and because we also ask them to be faithful in the gospel, BYU faculty members provide living examples of the power of learning by study and by faith. Students can first see, then work with, and eventually emulate role models who have demonstrated that they can excel in both their fields and their faithfulness. Experience of that kind is truly inspiring in both senses of the word. However, there is a limit to the number of faculty mentorship opportunities we can provide. As good as they are, our faculty have only twenty-four hours in a day, and they are already stretched almost to the limit. Fortunately, other experiential learning opportunities can also promote inspiring learning. Internships, study abroad programs, fieldwork, service learning opportunities, and even on-campus work are all experiences that, when properly structured, can provide opportunities to both inspire students to learn and help students learn to be inspired. To increase the number of students who can have such experiences, this year the university provided substantial additional funding to each college, with the central stipulation that the funds be directed to students to facilitate a structured experiential learning opportunity. Because the calendar year is not yet complete, it is too early to measure the overall impact of this increased funding in terms of the number of students having such opportunities. However, anecdotal reports from every college indicate that the funds have allowed numerous students to have an experiential learning opportunity that they otherwise would have had to forego for economic reasons. The results have been encouraging—enough that we are working to provide additional funding again in 2017 and to make securing even more funds one of the top fund-raising priorities for the university. Second, in addition to increasing the number of opportunities for inspiring learning experiences, we can work to make the opportunities have even more impact by being more purposeful and intentional about what happens in those activities. While traveling in a foreign country can be a life-changing experience, through careful and thoughtful planning, the impact of the experience can be magnified severalfold. Similarly, internships provide insights into the skills required to succeed in an occupation, but increased planning and foresight can make the experience considerably more meaningful by ensuring that certain kinds of activities occur and that there is adequate opportunity for reflection. I challenge all involved in such activities to make sure we are maximizing the amount of good that can result from them. Finally, we can increase the number of inspiring learning moments for our students if we recognize that both experiential learning and classroom learning are enhanced by the quality of the relationships we develop with our students. Research has shown that “high impact [learning] practices are powerful in part because they are relationship rich.”19 The 2014 Gallup-Purdue survey I mentioned earlier found that one of the key factors that correlated with success in both work engagement and overall well-being was a high-quality relationship with a faculty member. According to that data, a graduate’s chances of thriving at work and in life doubled if the student “had a professor who cared about them as a person, made them excited about learning, and encouraged them to pursue their dreams.”20 BYU should be a leader in this regard. Our mission statement provides that all relationships within the BYU community should reflect devout love of God and a loving, genuine concern for the welfare of our neighbor.21 If our students feel this, they will be inspired to learn, and they will learn to be inspired in profound ways. Let me share one example. Four years ago one of our graduate engineering students, Shannon Zirbel, received a $100,000 fellowship from NASA to work on a project with laminate-compliant mechanisms in space. She received a lot of attention, and we used her success in our fund-raising efforts for the new Engineering Building. People resonated with the idea that their donations might help bright students like Shannon be involved in cutting-edge work. She was very articulate and very gracious to share her time in informing people about her work as part of our fund-raising effort. It was only some time later that I learned the more complete story of her BYU experience that led to the fellowship. I share portions of her account with her permission: When I graduated from high school, I went to [Georgetown] University. . . . I had a misconception about BYU—I thought girls just came here to get married, . . . so I didn’t even apply to BYU. . . . Two years later I went on a mission. During my mission I served with several companions who were students at BYU, and my opinion of BYU changed entirely. When I came home from my mission, I applied to and was accepted at BYU. . . . I’m not brilliant. But I work hard, so I know I can accomplish good things, and hard things. But I need ready reassurance. Maybe it’s because I’m a [woman]. A [woman] in a male-dominated field, surrounded by men who, by nature, think differently than I do. Do you know how hard that is sometimes? One of my biggest concerns about staying for a PhD was the qualifying exams. Just prior to my taking them . . . , Dr. [Larry] Howell gave me a blessing. Being able to receive a priesthood blessing from my advisor was one of the highlight experiences of attending BYU. Every morning of the exam week I went in to get “words of encouragement” from Dr. Howell. On Wednesday morning (before the dynamics exam), as I was leaving his office, I said, “I’ll try to make you proud.” He replied, “You already have.” Can I tell you how much of a difference that made for me? I went into the exam feeling blissful, feeling like I didn’t have anything I needed to prove. I just had to do my best, and that was going to be enough. He couldn’t have said anything more perfect. I’ve had many experiences like that with professors at BYU, where they have shown such genuine concern for me. Inspiring learning will be greatly enhanced if those with whom we interact feel Christ’s love for them through us. Our efforts to enhance inspiring learning—the kind of education for eternity described in our mission statement—can have an enormous impact on all of our students. But it need not and should not end there. You will shortly hear from Elder Kim B. Clark about a new global initiative in the Church Educational System—an effort to provide learning to Saints and others throughout the world. This initiative is inspiring and will give us the opportunity to magnify the impact of what we do here. However, I believe we can best accomplish that by focusing on our principal and board-directed role, which is to enhance the learning experience of our students in all the ways described in the mission statement. We need not alter or change our focus; we simply need to do well—to do better—what we are already doing and then look for new ways to share. The mission statement succinctly sums up how we can best help in words that, though written nearly thirty-five years ago, seem somehow to have this initiative specifically in mind: In meeting these objectives BYU’s faculty, staff, students, and administrators should also be anxious to make their service and scholarship available to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in furthering its work worldwide.22 We should be anxious to make our service and scholarship available to the Church in this exciting worldwide endeavor, but we can best do so by meeting the objectives set forth in the mission statement. Our mission is clear and simple. It can, in one sense, be captured in the phrase “inspiring learning.” But it is more accurately and more fully described in our inspiring and inspired mission statement. As we face the opportunities and challenges of the coming year, I urge you to return to that mission statement often and to contemplate what your role is in carrying out that mission. I promise that as you do so, inspiration will come. It will come to you and it will come to your students. You are not here by accident and they are not here by accident. Our coming together will allow God’s work to go forward, both in our own individual lives and in the lives of others on this campus and throughout the world. I so testify, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen. <start> If you make and keep sacred covenants, if you prepare yourself daily for spiritual experiences through scripture study and prayer, if you align and bind yourselves with God, a light will emanate from you. Every April the Area Seventies from throughout the world gather in Salt Lake City, along with the General Authorities and general auxiliary presidencies, for instruction from members of the First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve, and the Presidency of the Seventy. The instruction focuses on the most fundamental and most pressing issues of the Church—things like temple work, strengthening members, the Atonement, and hastening the work of salvation. It is a privilege to sit at the feet of these inspired leaders and to learn what is on their minds and in their hearts. Two years ago, in April 2013, President Thomas S. Monson addressed the group and spent all of his time talking about just one topic: you—the youth of the Church. Think about that. Of all the important things that President Monson could have addressed—missionary work, temples, or Church leadership—he said that it was the youth of the Church that had been on his mind the most. He noted that as youth today, you are living in a time of infinite promise, a time when you will face unique challenges. He observed that you are truly a royal generation, reserved to come forth in this special time for particular purposes. President Monson’s remarks reminded me of two comments made by Elder Neal A. Maxwell. Speaking to youth at a BYU fireside a number of years ago, Elder Maxwell said: The highest compliment I can pay to you is that God has placed you here and now at this time to serve in his kingdom; so much is about to happen in which you will be involved and concerning which you will have some great influence.1 In another setting Elder Maxwell provided some additional context for that statement. Referring to the early days of this dispensation, he stated: The Church has done many difficult things, and from these achievements one would not wish to detract. But all the easy things the Church has had to do have been done. From now on it is high adventure!2 Now, Elder Maxwell did not say that everything the early Saints did was easy. Clearly that was not the case. Those early stalwart Church members faced challenges that were daunting—challenges that would test the souls of the most valiant of us. However, Elder Maxwell did say that all the “easy things” that needed to be done have been done. “From now on, it is high adventure!” You have been reserved to come to earth at this time of high adventure because God knows you are capable of meeting the challenges which that adventure will bring. Today I would like to discuss with you a few ideas about what you might do to prepare yourselves to successfully encounter the high adventure that lies ahead of you, both individually and as members of God’s kingdom here on earth. My advice begins with a scriptural admonition, one that some of you will recognize as the Young Men and Young Women theme from two years ago: “Stand in holy places.”3 If you are to succeed in your role in the high adventure that is in your future, you must be grounded in the strength that comes from worthily being in holy places, where you can feel and be strengthened by the Spirit. As the Church handbook makes clear, those “holy places include temples . . . and chapels.”4 Regular church and temple attendance will bring great power in your lives—power you will need to face both the everyday and the extraordinary challenges you will encounter. But in today’s world, more will be expected of you than to just stand in holy places. My plea is not just that you stand in holy places but that you make holy the places in which you stand. As Sister Sharon G. Larsen, a former member of the Young Women general presidency, once explained: Holy places can be wherever you are—alone, in a crowd, with strangers, with friends. The road to Jericho was treacherous and formidable. Thieves infiltrated the bushes and trees waiting to ambush any traveler. It took a kind and courageous Samaritan to change that road from a haunted place to a holy place.5 As followers of Christ, we are capable of doing more than standing in holy places. We can make any place holy—not just our temples and chapels but also our homes, our workplaces, and our locker rooms. We have the ability, like the good Samaritan, to change the areas in which we stand from haunted places to holy places. Elder Jeffrey R. Holland illustrated how this can happen when he spoke of the experience of Joseph Smith in Liberty Jail. If there were any place likely to be considered unholy or haunted, it would be that small jail, located near the western frontier of America, in the winter of 1838–39. As described by Elder Holland: The jail . . . was considered escape proof, and it probably was. It had two stories. The . . . main floor was accessible to the outside world only by a single small, heavy door. In the middle of that floor was a trapdoor through which prisoners were then lowered into the lower floor or dungeon. The outside walls . . . were . . . two feet thick, with inside walls of 12-inch . . . logs. These two walls were separated by a 12-inch space filled with loose rock. Combined, these walls made a . . . virtually impenetrable barrier four feet thick.6 Joseph and his companions spent more than four months in that setting. Elder Holland continued: The food given to the prisoners was coarse and sometimes contaminated, so filthy that one of them said they “could not eat it until [they] were driven to it by hunger.” On as many as four occasions they had poison administered to them in their food, making them so violently ill that for days they alternated between vomiting and a kind of delirium, not really caring whether they lived or died. In the Prophet Joseph’s letters, he spoke of the jail being a “hell, surrounded with demons . . . where we are compelled to hear nothing but blasphemous oaths, and witness a scene of blasphemy, and drunkenness and hypocrisy, and debaucheries of every description.”7 Elder Holland included further descriptions from Joseph Smith’s letters: “We have . . . not blankets sufficient to keep us warm; and when we have a fire, we are obliged to have almost a constant smoke.”8 “Our souls have been bowed down”9 and “my nerve trembles from long confinement.”10 “Pen, or tongue, or angels [could not describe] the malice of hell that I have suffered.”11 That is not the kind of place that you or I would describe as holy. And yet it was in that setting that the Prophet received and recorded some of the most sublime revelations of this dispensation, including sections 121, 122, and 123 of the Doctrine and Covenants. The outpouring of the Holy Spirit was so profound in that jail that B. H. Roberts, as Elder Holland noted, rightly referred to it as a “prison-temple.”12 Surely if such a place can become holy, then the places in which we find ourselves can similarly be altered. Once again, as Sister Larsen stated, “Holy places can be wherever you are—alone, in a crowd, with strangers, with friends.” Or, as Elder Holland put it: We love and cherish our dedicated temples and the essential, exalting ordinances that are performed there. . . . They are truly the holiest, most sacred structures in the kingdom of God, to which we all ought to go as worthily and as often as possible. But . . . when you have to, you can have sacred, revelatory, profoundly instructive experience with the Lord in any situation you are in. Indeed, let me say that even a little stronger: You can have sacred, revelatory, profoundly instructive experience with the Lord in the most miserable experiences of your life—in the worst settings.13 Haunted places truly can become holy places. So what do we need to do to have the power to make such a change in the places in which we stand? The first thing is to recognize that we cannot do this alone. No matter how good we are, no matter how talented we are, no matter how influential we are, we do not have the ability to make such changes on our own. The sole source of such transformational power is God. If we are to make haunted places into holy places, we need to tap into His power. How do we do that? Let me suggest a simple two-step process: We must first align ourselves with Him, and then we need to bind ourselves to Him. It is that simple. If we align ourselves with God and then bind ourselves to Him, we will be endowed with power to transform prisons into temples, humble dwellings into celestial abodes, and places of despair into havens of hope. So how do we align ourselves with God? He has indicated that the best way to do that is to believe in and align ourselves with His Only Begotten Son. 14 We align ourselves with God by becoming true followers of the Lord Jesus Christ—by patterning our lives after His example. When we do that, we are changed in significant ways. As explained in the Church handbook: As we become true followers of Jesus Christ, we experience a mighty change of heart and “have no more disposition to do evil.” . . . As we live the gospel of Jesus Christ, we grow line upon line, becoming more like the Savior in loving and serving others.15 Let me suggest two simple practices that can help us come into more complete alignment with the Savior: daily scripture study and daily prayer. I know that these are not new suggestions. You have all heard them before, but I worry that in this regard we can—to use Alma’s words to his son Helaman—become “slothful because of the easiness of the way.”16 When I was called as a bishop of a young single adult ward many years ago, our stake president was a wise, loving, and very seasoned priesthood leader. He had been a bishop, a stake president, and a mission president. He had seen it all. At one of our early training meetings he urged us to encourage our ward members to engage in daily scripture study and daily prayers. He said, “I have yet to find anyone who is studying the scriptures and praying on a daily basis who has an ongoing serious problem with the Church and its commandments.” I must confess that the first thought that came to my mind—sparked perhaps by the skepticism that legal training seems to inculcate in people—was, “Surely that can’t be true. It is way too simple.” But I can assure you now, more than twenty-five years later, after having served as a bishop twice, as a stake president, and now as an Area Seventy, I have yet to find anyone who is studying the scriptures and praying on a daily basis who has an ongoing serious problem with the Church and its commandments. It really is that simple. The daily practice of serious study of the scriptures and sincere prayer keeps the Savior enough in our minds and the Spirit enough in our lives that we will either make the necessary corrections to stay in overall alignment with the Savior or we will stop studying and reading the scriptures and praying because it is too uncomfortable. This does not mean you won’t have challenges or questions. You will. But daily scripture study and daily prayer will keep you on the path—will keep you aligned with the Savior and our Father in Heaven—to such a degree that you will find, over time, you are a better person, one more able to not only stand in holy places but also make holy the places in which you stand. But alignment with God in the abstract sense is not, by itself, sufficient to generate the power to transform our lives and the places we inhabit. We must not only align ourselves with God—we must also bind ourselves to Him. We need to draw upon God’s power not only to meet the challenges we face but also to be transformed by them. And we do that by binding ourselves to Him. As Elder Holland explained, “Every experience can become a redemptive experience if we remain bonded to our Father in Heaven through that difficulty.”17 And how do we bind ourselves to God? Through covenants. As Sister Linda K. Burton once noted, “Making and keeping covenants means choosing to bind ourselves to our Father in Heaven and Jesus Christ.”18 Covenants are “sacred and enduring promise[s] between God and His children.” 19 In the words of Elder D. Todd Christofferson, “In these divine agreements, God binds Himself to sustain, sanctify, and exalt us in return for our commitment to serve Him and keep His commandments.”20 I think we sometimes underestimate the centrality of covenants in the gospel plan. It was only a few years ago I consciously recognized that the title of our scriptural collection of modern revelation focuses on covenants. We call those scriptures the Doctrine and Covenants. Maybe it would be more clear if we referred to it as the Doctrine and the Covenants, because those two things constitute the focus of revelation in this dispensation: the doctrine, meaning the principles of truth we need to understand, and the covenants, which lead us to employ and effectuate those truths in our lives. Covenants are so powerful because it is through covenants that God’s general promises are made operative in our individual lives. Elder Christofferson explained it this way: Our covenants supply strength—they produce the faith necessary to persevere and to do all things that are expedient in the Lord. . . . In the first place, the promised fruits of obedience become evident, which confirms our faith. Secondly, the Spirit communicates God’s pleasure, and we feel secure in His continued blessing and help. Thirdly, come what may, we can face life with hope and equanimity, knowing that we will succeed in the end because we have God’s promise to us individually, by name, and we know He cannot lie.21 My advice to you in this regard is the same as that given by the Lord to Emma Smith in section 25 of the Doctrine and Covenants: “Cleave unto the covenants which thou hast made.”22 Cleave does not mean to casually and lightly grasp. It means “to cling or hold fast to; to attach oneself.” 23 The word cleave derives from the Old Norse word klîfa, which means “to . . . climb by clinging.”24 That is a pretty good visual image of how we can increase our potential for good. We climb upward by clinging, by hanging on with all our might to the covenants we have made with God, secure in His promise that He will keep His end of the agreement if we keep ours. If we do align and bind ourselves with God, it will make a profound difference both to the quality of our lives and to the lives of others in ways we may not fully recognize. Let me illustrate by reference to the image of a lighthouse. All of us are familiar with lighthouses. They send out a beacon of light that can hopefully be seen in the worst weather. They mark the line where the sea ends and the land begins—a very important marker for those who are piloting boats in bad weather. Lighthouses are fixed and immovable. They are constant, and sailors can therefore rely on them. But lighthouses also have another role to play for those who are piloting boats in bad weather. In addition to marking the place where the sea ends and the land begins, lighthouses can, with the help of other lights, guide sailors through treacherous waters where there are reefs and other unseen barriers that might sink the ship. In such situations there is often only one safe passage to the harbor, and the only way the pilot knows the ship is in that passage is by maneuvering the ship so that the light at the top of the lighthouse aligns with the carefully placed light on the shore. Once the ship is in that position, it can proceed safely, as long as those lights—the one in the lighthouse and the one on the shore—are in alignment with each other. If they are out of alignment, the ship is off course, and there is considerable risk of a tragic shipwreck. In the October 2012 general conference, President Boyd K. Packer related an incident that explains this very well. On one occasion he was assigned to a stake conference in Western Samoa. As part of the conference the group had to travel from Savai’i to Mulifanua on Upolu Island. They had originally planned to go by plane, but weather conditions prevented that, so they set out on a forty-foot boat. What they did not know is that they were headed into the center of a ferocious tropical storm. After many hours they crossed the rough seas and arrived at the harbor at Mulifanua. President Packer explained what happened next: We arrived in the harbor at Mulifanua. There was one narrow passage we were to go through along the reef. A light on the hill above the beach and a second lower light marked the narrow passage. When a boat was maneuvered so that the two lights were one above the other, the boat would be lined up properly to pass through the dangerous rocks that lined the passage. But that night there was only one light. Two elders were waiting on the landing to meet us, but the crossing took much longer than usual. After watching for hours for signs of our boat, the elders tired and fell asleep, neglecting to turn on the second light, the lower light. As a result, the passage through the reef was not clear. The captain maneuvered the boat as best he could toward the one upper light on shore while a crewman held [a] flashlight over the bow, searching for rocks ahead. We could hear the breakers crashing over the reef. When we were close enough to see them with the flashlight, the captain frantically shouted reverse and backed away to try again to locate the passage. After many attempts, he knew it would be impossible to find the passage [without the second light]. All we could do was try to reach the harbor at Apia 40 miles (64 km) away. We were helpless against the ferocious power of the elements.25 The group eventually made their way to safety, but it was a harrowing experience. President Packer observed, “I do not know who had been waiting for us at the beach at Mulifanua. . . . But it is true that without that lower light, we all might have been lost.”26 Let me share a similar story: More than a hundred years ago, a well-known Protestant preacher, Dwight L. Moody, shared a story of a ship trying to enter the Cleveland harbor on a very stormy night. The ship’s captain could see the bright light of the Cleveland harbor lighthouse. However, the lower lights weren’t visible at all. The lower lights were the way that ships identified the centerline of the safe entry to a harbor. Because the lower lights were not burning that night, the ship missed the entrance to the harbor and crashed into rocks. Many lives were lost. At the end of his sermon, Moody said, “Brethren, the Master will take care of the great lighthouse; let us keep the lower lights burning.”27 One of the members of Moody’s congregation that day was a man named Philip Paul Bliss, a musician. Bliss was so inspired by the lesson in Moody’s sermon that he wrote a hymn, which in our hymnbook is entitled “Brightly Beams Our Father’s Mercy.” Many of you will be familiar with the hymn. All of you should be. With the image of the lighthouse and these experiences in mind, listen to the first verse of that hymn: Brightly beams our Father’s mercy From his lighthouse evermore, But to us he gives the keeping Of the lights along the shore. Let the lower lights be burning; Send a gleam across the wave. Some poor fainting, struggling seaman You may rescue, you may save.28 The lighthouse of God’s love for His children is ever present and never moving. Some people will see it and will be drawn to it, but they may not know how to get to it. They will be looking for someone—some lower light—to show them the safe passage to that light. Their feelings may be like those found in a letter President Monson received from a less-active member of the Church: “I know where the Church is, but sometimes I think I need someone else to show me the way, encourage me, take away my fear, and bear testimony to me.”29 There may be many around you in the places in which you stand who are in the same position. They want to do what is right, they want to have greater peace in their lives, and they want to come closer to God, but they are unsure of how to do it. Your example may provide the lower lights they need to see the safe passage. More may depend on your scripture study, prayer, and covenant keeping than just your well-being. Others may be affected by your doing these things as well. Let me close with an example of how one whose light was burning bright affected others and turned what was a haunted place, at least for one person, into a holy place. It comes from an article written by Rick Reilly, who in my opinion is one of the best sportswriters of our time. It was written in the fall of 2012. Because he writes so well, I will quote extensively from his version of the story: In the scrub-brush desert town of Queen Creek, Ariz., high school bullies were throwing trash at sophomore Chy Johnson. Calling her “stupid.” Pushing her in the halls. [Making it, I would say, a haunted place.] Chy’s brain works at only a third-grade level because of a genetic birth defect, but she knew enough to feel hate. “She’d come home every night at the start of the school year crying and upset,” says her mom, Liz Johnson. “That permanent smile she had, that gleam in her eye, that was all gone.” Her mom says she tried to talk to teachers and administrators and got nowhere. So she tried a whole new path—the starting quarterback of the undefeated football team. After all, senior Carson Jones had once escorted Chy to the Special Olympics. “Just keep your ear to the ground,” Liz wrote to Carson on his Facebook page. “Maybe get me some names?” But Carson Jones did something better than that. Instead of ratting other kids out, he decided to take one in—Chy. He started asking her to eat at the cool kids’ lunch table with him and his teammates. “I just thought that if they saw her with us every day, maybe they’d start treating her better,” Carson says. . . . It got better. Starting running back Tucker Workman made sure somebody was walking between classes with Chy. In classes, cornerback Colton Moore made sure she sat in the row right behind the team. Just step back a second. In some schools, it’s the football players doing the bullying. At Queen Creek, they’re stopping it. And not with fists—with straight-up love for a kid most teenage football players wouldn’t even notice, much less hang out with. . . . It’s working. “I was parking my car yesterday, and I saw a couple of the guys talking to her and being nice,” says offensive lineman Bryce Oakes. “I think it’s making a difference around here.” And the best thing is? The football players didn’t tell anybody. “I didn’t know about any of this until three weeks ago,” says Carson’s mom, Rondalee, who’s raising four boys and a daughter by herself. “He finally showed me an article they wrote here locally. I said, ‘Are you kidding me? Why didn’t you tell me this?’” All of a sudden, Chy started coming home as her bubbly self again. When her mom asked why she was so happy, she said, “I’m eating lunch with my boys!” . . . I get emailed stories like this a lot, but most of the time they don’t pan out. They turn out to be half true, or true for the first week but not the second. But when I walked into the Queen Creek High School cafeteria Tuesday, unannounced, there was 4-foot-high Chy with 11 senior football players, eating her lunch around the most packed lunch table you’ve ever seen, grinning like it was Christmas morning. . . . “I thank Carson every chance I see him,” says Chy’s mom. “He’s an amazing young man. He’s going to go far in life.” Nobody knows how far Chy Johnson will go in life. The life expectancy of those afflicted with her disease, microcephaly, is only 25–30 years. But her sophomore year, so far, has been unforgettable. [I might say it has been turned from a haunted place into a holy place.] . . . But what about next year, when Carson probably will be on his Mormon mission and all of Chy’s boys will have graduated? Not to worry. Carson has a little brother on the team, Curtis, who’s in Chy’s class. “Mom,” he announced at the dinner table the other night, “I got this.” Lucky girl.30 One person setting an example for others—who probably wanted to help but didn’t know how—and, all of a sudden, a haunted place became a holy place. If you make and keep sacred covenants, if you prepare yourself daily for spiritual experiences through scripture study and prayer, if you align and bind yourselves with God, a light will emanate from you. Others will be drawn to that light, which is just a reflection of God’s light, and they will be drawn to Him. As that happens, you will not only be able to stand in holy places but you will also make the places in which you stand holy for you and for others. I bear you my witness that God lives. He has a perfect plan for each one of us. He places us where we can help others. That plan includes the birth, Atonement, death, and Resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ, who leads this work today. I bear you my witness of these elements of the plan and of the truths that have been restored through Joseph Smith, and I do so in the name of Jesus Christ, amen. <start> Whatever the circumstances you find yourself in, know with assurance that you can succeed. You are more capable, more talented, and more faith-filled than you realize. More important, you are more loved by God than you realize. It is a joy to join with Peggy in welcoming you to another school year. You are a wonderful sight, and this campus takes on new energy as you arrive here. We are grateful for that. My message today focuses on one of the most oft-repeated and yet most oft-overlooked and ignored and maybe violated commandments. By my count this commandment is repeated seventy-six times in the scriptures.1 The commandment was the first thing spoken by the angels who announced Christ’s birth to the shepherds outside Bethlehem.2 It was also the first thing spoken by the angels who announced Christ’s Resurrection to the women at the empty tomb.3 The commandment was conveyed by the angels who informed Mary and Joseph about their roles in the Savior’s mortal ministry,4 and it was part of the message of the angel who appeared to Zacharias to reveal the upcoming birth of John the Baptist.5 The commandment is repeated in at least two of our LDS hymns.6 It is a commandment that is found so frequently in the scriptures that we may not recognize its profound importance, especially for the times in which we live and the stage of life in which you students find yourselves. The commandment is a simple two-word injunction: “fear not.” Some may question whether the directive to “fear not” is actually a commandment. True, it is not preceded by the familiar “thou shalt not,” and it was not written on stone tablets. But it is clearly an imperative repeated often enough by divinely authorized sources, including many times by the Savior Himself,7 that it certainly seems like a commandment. More important, like all commandments, adherence to this two-word injunction will make our mortal journey both more productive and more joyful. This is not a new topic. It has been preached over this pulpit8 as well as over the pulpit in the LDS Conference Center.9 But I believe it is one that is of particular relevance as we begin a new school year with all of its challenges in a world that seems increasingly full of fears. I firmly believe that if we increase our compliance with this important commandment, the coming year and the endless years that succeed it will be better. With that belief in mind, let me first explore the meaning of this sometimes misunderstood commandment and then describe four things we can do to increase our ability to comply with its principles. What Is Fear? To understand the commandment to fear not, we first have to understand what we mean by fear. What exactly are we supposed to avoid? According to one source, “fear is a feeling induced by perceived danger or threat that . . . ultimately [leads to] a change in behavior.”10 As this broad definition suggests, not all fear is bad. Were it not for this emotion, we would not flee from or avoid things that would actually harm us. The feeling that might arise when we hear the signature tail warning of a rattlesnake is one we should not ignore. It keeps us safe. Similarly, the scriptures indicate that we are to “fear the Lord.”11 Surely we should not avoid this kind of fear. As Elder David A. Bednar once explained, this “righteous fear” is much different from the fear we are commanded to avoid. Righteous fear is instead “a deep feeling of reverence, respect, and awe for the Lord Jesus Christ,” a feeling that induces “obedience to His commandments . . . and anticipation of the Final Judgment and justice at His hand.”12 This kind of “godly fear dispels mortal fears”13 and thus aids in our compliance with the commandment to fear not. So if fear of real danger and fear of God are not covered by this commandment, just what is it that we are commanded to avoid? The fear that the scriptural injunction directs us to suppress falls into the category of what some psychologists call “irrational fear” or “fear of the unknown,”14 a fear of future events that will not likely occur. Using the letters of the term itself, some refer to this as “False Evidence Appearing Real”—FEAR.15 It is this false-evidence-appearing-real type of fear that Satan seeks to induce in us and that the Lord commands us to avoid. It is a kind of fear that is debilitating, sometimes paralyzing, and almost always soul- and energy-sapping. For some, this kind of fear takes the form of thoughts that you are not good enough to succeed here at BYU; for others, it takes the form of thoughts that you do not belong here because you are different from those around you. For some, it is a fear that you will never find an eternal companion; for others, it is a fear that the future appears so ominous and dangerous that marriage and a family seem too risky. And, for far too many, this fear comes in the form of the false belief that you are not acceptable to God, that you are so flawed because of past mistakes or current inadequacies that you are beyond the reach of the refining and redeeming power of Jesus Christ. When any of these false thoughts appears to be real to you, when such satanic lies cause you to lose hope in the future and maybe even in the present, please remember that God has repeatedly commanded us to “fear not.” That commandment falls clearly within the ambit of Nephi’s well-known and eternally true observation that “the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.”16 Four Things We Can Do With that in mind, let me suggest four things we can do in such trying times to comply with the commandment to fear not. First, recognize and remember that this kind of “fear comes not of God, but . . . from [Satan,] the adversary of truth and righteousness.”17 Indeed, as President Gordon B. Hinckley taught, “Fear is the antithesis [the complete opposite] of faith.”18 This is evident from the scriptures themselves. The scriptures define faith as “the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen,”19 “which are true.”20 Faith is a real manifestation of what is really true. The polar opposite of that would seem to be the lack of substance or evidence of things that are false—or false evidence appearing real: fear. We need to recognize that the feeling of despair and hopelessness that characterizes irrational fear is a tool of the adversary. Indeed, it is one of his primary tools. I am convinced that just as we have articles of faith, Satan and his minions must have articles of fear to aid them in their work. They might read something like this: “We believe that the first principles of despair and damnation are doubt God, doubt yourself, doubt others, and, most of all, be afraid—be very afraid of the future.”21 I am certain the adversary fully understands that fear and faith cannot coexist. If we fail to understand that truth, we are at a comparative disadvantage. On the other hand, if we remember that simple fact in the moments when we are gripped by irrational fear, we not only will be able to recognize the true source of what President Hinckley called the “gnawing, destructive element”22 of fear but also will understand the cure for those debilitating feelings. As President Russell M. Nelson has reminded us, “Faith is the antidote for fear.”23 If we want to decrease the amount of fear in our lives, we need to increase the amount of faith in our lives. But it is not faith in the abstract that is the antidote to such fear. It is, as the fourth article of faith makes clear, “faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.” If we want to decrease the amount of irrational fear in our lives, we need to increase our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. So when fear threatens to overwhelm us, we should focus less on those fears and more on increasing our faith in Him who admonishes us to “look unto [Him] in every thought; doubt not, fear not.”24 And how do we do that? By getting to know the Savior better. The more we know Christ, the more we will trust and love Him and the more faith we will have in Him. In that regard, I urge each of you as the new school year begins to spend time on a daily basis getting to know Him through daily scripture study and prayer. These simple acts of daily scripture study and prayer—especially with the intent to know the Savior better—will do more than almost anything else to strengthen your faith in Him, which, in turn, will decrease the amount of irrational fear in your life, no matter the particular cause of that fear. So set aside time on a daily basis—in the morning or in the evening—to strengthen your faith in Christ through daily scripture study and prayer. Second, we can increase the amount of faith and decrease the amount of fear in our lives by serving others more. As the Lectures on Faith indicate, faith is a “principle of action.”25 It grows and operates in our lives only when we are willing to exercise our agency in an active way. If we want to increase our faith in a way that dispels our fears, we need to act. And often the best way to act is to serve others. Irrational fear causes us to focus on ourselves—on our own inadequacies and on our own inability to control things. When we focus on others and what we can do to help them, fear fades. This is just one way in which, as the scriptures teach us, “perfect love casteth out all fear.”26 I learned this in a powerful way while serving as a missionary in Mexico. In the early part of my mission, I was hesitant to speak, both because I am by nature an introvert and because my Spanish was not very good. I greatly feared that I would be embarrassed. I was focused on myself. One day as I walked down the street, I suddenly had a feeling overcome me that I can only credit to the Holy Ghost: it was a clear feeling that all of the people I saw bustling about me that day were literally my brothers and sisters and that all of them were sons and daughters of my Heavenly Parents, who were also their Heavenly Parents. Without any conscious effort on my part, I felt overwhelming love for each person I saw. At that moment I felt a great desire to speak to them. I was anxious to share with them words that would help them see their divine destiny, even if the words were not in perfect Spanish. I suddenly found that I cared more about them and their well-being than about my potential embarrassment. My fear of being embarrassed disappeared and was replaced by an almost consuming love for those people. As I shifted my focus from me and my inadequacies to others and their needs, my fear was cast out by the love that I felt. Similarly, when you find yourself overcome by fear, I urge you to look for others who need your help. Focus on what you can do for them—on what they need. If you do this, I promise your fears will decrease because your love for God and His children will increase. And, as President Dieter F. Uchtdorf recently reminded us, perfect love is also a “divinely appointed antidote to fear.”27 Third, we can increase the amount of faith in our lives if we understand that, as Elder Neil L. Andersen once observed, “Faith is not only a feeling; it is a decision.”28 “Faith is a choice.”29 There will be repeated times during this semester and during the rest of your lives when you will have a choice whether to be governed by faith or by fear. I urge you to be quick to recognize when that is the choice you face, because it is not always immediately apparent. If you are more aware of the fact that you are making a choice between faith and fear, you will more often make the right choice. If you do not pause to recognize that fact, fear may overcome you without you even realizing it. Let me illustrate with an example. A number of years ago I had an assignment on campus that involved athletics. In that role I was invited to attend a banquet for the women student athletes at which Sister Sheri L. Dew was the speaker. Any of you who have heard Sister Dew speak would understand how excited I was to be invited. She is a gifted speaker and a wonderful gospel scholar. I very much looked forward to hearing from her. Unfortunately, at the last minute a conflict arose, and, much to my disappointment, I was not able to attend. As you can imagine, then, I was especially excited when I was invited to the exact same event the next year and learned that one of the speakers was again to be Sheri Dew. This time I was able to attend. I was particularly thrilled when Sister Dew started off her remarks by saying that she was going to begin by telling the same story she had told the year before—allowing me to catch up. I was pleasantly surprised, thinking maybe she was doing this just for my sake. However, she quickly made clear that while she was going to tell the same story she had told the previous year, this year she was telling it to make an entirely different point from the one she had made the year before. Sister Dew explained that she had begun her remarks the prior year by telling the women student athletes how thrilled she was to be invited to speak because she had long wanted to be a part of BYU athletics. She said something to this effect: You will remember that I told you that when I arrived at BYU, I felt like I was the most ill-prepared, socially awkward freshman who had ever set foot on this campus. I told you then that I was from a very small town in Kansas—a town much smaller than the student population of BYU—and I felt completely overwhelmed, wondering if I would ever fit in. But there was one thing I thought might provide an entry into the BYU community, and that was basketball. I had played basketball in high school in Kansas, and, quite frankly, I thought I was pretty good. So I decided I would try out for the women’s basketball team. I learned all I could about the team: who the coach was, who had left the team, who was returning, and when the tryouts were to be held. Sister Dew then said: You will recall that I told you last year how I summoned up all my courage and went to the appointed gym in the Richards Building where tryouts were to be held. Wanting to make sure I maximized my chances, I had arrived early. You will also remember how I told you that I opened the door to the gym with some confidence, and then I watched the girls who were playing there. I thought to myself, “Wow, they are really good.” You will remember how I told you that I closed the door and then spent the next three hours walking up and down the hallways of the Richards Building trying to muster up enough courage to go back for the tryouts but that I finally gave up and returned to my dorm room without making the effort to try out. I told you that story last year so that you would understand that I truly meant it when I told you that I was thrilled more than you knew that I had been asked to speak to the women student athletes at BYU and to be made an honorary member of that group. I wanted you to know that it really was the fulfillment of a lifelong dream. But I am telling you this same story this year for a much different purpose because of what happened immediately after I spoke last year. After I had spoken last year, Sister Elaine Michaelis came up to me. Now many of you here will know Sister Michaelis. She is one of the legendary figures in BYU athletics. She worked in the Athletics Department for more than forty years, serving as women’s athletics director for much of that time. She was such an impactful and ­successful ­women’s volleyball coach that the volleyball court in the Smith Fieldhouse is named for her. During her coaching career at BYU, Elaine Michaelis at one time or another coached every single women’s sport. Now, with that background, let me share what Sister Dew went on to say: Sister Michaelis had spoken after me last year, and she then engaged me in a conversation while we were still on the podium. Sister Michaelis asked me, “Sheri, is that story true?” “Of course it’s true,” I replied. Sister Michaelis then responded, “Do you know who the coach of the women’s basketball team was the year you were a freshman?” “Yes, I do,” I said. “It was you. I knew everything about the team that year.” Then Sister Michaelis said, “I should tell you something, Sheri. In all my many years of coaching and of all the teams that I coached, there was only one year and one team that did not have a full roster. It was the women’s basketball team that year. We were one player short.” Sister Dew then said, pretending to stab ­herself in the heart: It would not have hurt any more to be stabbed in the heart than to have heard those words. There was a place for me on that team. God had prepared a way for me to fit in and had given me inspiration as to what I should do, and I let my fears keep me from that blessing.30 Sister Dew’s life turned out okay—we don’t need to worry about her—and the women’s basketball team survived without her as well. But that is just evidence that God truly can make “all things [including our own mistakes] work together for [our] good”31 if we will love and trust Him. But He will also bless us in the interim—in the short run and in the long run—if our choices are directed by our faith in Him rather than by our fears about ourselves. Be alert to the times during which you must choose between fear and faith. Those times confront us more often than we usually recognize. Fourth, even if we recognize that faith is a choice and that we are facing that choice, we may doubt our ability to make that choice—­especially in pressure situations. Too many of us too often worry whether we are capable of choosing faith when it really counts. If that is a concern, I urge you to recognize that you already exercised incredible faith in Christ at a most critical juncture in your eternal journey. You are all familiar with the scene. We were gathered together in a Grand Council in which our Father in Heaven described His plan for us to become like Him. Critical to that plan was the role of a Savior—someone who would live His life and give His life in a perfect way, thereby allowing Him to perform an atoning sacrifice that would enable us to gain the experience we needed to have in this fallen world without being condemned by the inevitable mistakes we would make.32 But there was also another plan presented, one put forth by Lucifer. A war was waged between the adherents of these two plans. As recorded in the book of Revelation, we were on the winning side. It was not a physical war but rather a war of words, a war of concepts—a war in which faith was our main weapon. Listen to how we prevailed, as described in Revelation 12: And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon. . . . And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony.33 It was the strength of our testimonies in Christ that allowed us to overcome Satan. It was our faith in Jesus Christ. Think about it. At that time the blood of the Lamb had not yet been shed and the Atonement had not yet been performed. All we had was the promise of our Heavenly Father and Christ that Jesus would perform His role perfectly. It all rose or fell on that. And we had the choice of whether we would believe in that promise in those circumstances. All we had was our faith in Him. But in that critical time, we all chose to be governed by faith and not by fear. If we sometimes doubt whether we really believe and whether we can act on that belief when it most counts, we can be emboldened by the reassuring fact that we believed before—and we believed with such certainty that the forces of darkness were compelled to flee from our presence. In your moments of doubt, despair, and fear, when you wonder if you can choose faith, remember that you already made that choice once when faced with that same decision in the pre-earth life. As Elder Robert D. Hales once noted: The blessings we enjoy now are because we made the choice to follow the Savior before this life. To everyone hearing . . . these words, whoever you are and whatever your past may be, remember this: it is not too late to make that same choice again and follow Him.34 My dear brothers and sisters: fear not. Whatever the circumstances you find yourself in, know with assurance that you can succeed. You are more capable, more talented, and more faith-filled than you realize. More important, you are more loved by God than you realize. God lives. He is our Heavenly Father. He has placed you on earth at this time and in this place because He knows you can succeed and that you can help others succeed in this particular setting. May the heavens open to give you glimpses of that truth and that destiny is my prayer as we begin this new semester. I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ, amen. <start> I hope that because of our efforts to create a community of belonging, we may one day say, "The campus of BYU, the mountains of BYU, the buildings of BYU, how beautiful are they to the eyes of them who there came to the knowledge of their Redeemer as their hearts were knit together in love." I join Peggy in welcoming you to this new semester. You are a wonderful sight. In my opening devotional two years ago, I spoke on the need for us to physically gather together in Provo. Citing the Prophet Joseph Smith’s observation that “compact society is absolutely necessary”1 to the educational enterprise, I boldly proclaimed, “There is something about physical proximity—about gathering in a compact society—that is essential to . . . the kind of education that is most important [to us].”2 Six months later, that message of gathering and proximity was suddenly replaced by a plea to scatter and socially distance. Talk about a statement that did not age well. Like so many other things, the desirability of physical proximity and compact society seemed to be radically altered by the coronavirus. Given the apparent limited shelf life of my ­message about the importance of physically gathering and the continued, unwelcome presence of the pandemic, some might think this devotional would present me with a good opportunity to confess my error and admit that COVID has permanently changed everything, including the desirability of gathering in a compact society. Instead, even though we are wearing masks—and even though I am still strongly urging each of you to get vaccinated if you haven’t done so already—I am unwilling to concede to the coronavirus. Indeed, today I am going to double down on the concept of gathering and proximity, believing that these are eternal principles that will remain applicable well beyond COVID and likely well beyond this mortal existence. While we need to temporarily adjust some features of our educational endeavor until the pandemic abates, it is, in my view, more important than ever that we be with one another during this educational ­process—that we be part of a community. “The Waning of Belonging” Sociologists and philosophers have long noted the human need to join with one another. More than two thousand years ago, Aristotle opined that man is by nature a social or “political animal”3—that we have a deep-seated, innate desire to live and associate with others and to form communities. Well before that, the Lord observed that “it is not good that . . . man [or woman] should be alone,”4 reflecting not just the importance of marriage but also the larger principle “that no one can flourish in isolation and that the quality of our relationships with others will ultimately determine our level of fulfillment and happiness in both this mortal existence and the life to come.”5 Thus, there is within each of us a natural desire to give up a part of ourselves to a larger collective, to be part of a community. At the same time, there is also within each of us a desire—a deep-seated need—to be individually unique, free to act for ourselves, and independent from external constraints or commitments. This is reflected in the gospel concept of agency: our ability to choose our own destiny without interference from others, consistent with eternal law.6 There is, at one level, inevitable tension between these two concepts. As political scientist Robert D. Putnam has written, “The relationship between the individual and the community is one of the timeless dualisms of social thought.”7 Humans seem to vacillate between wanting to belong and wanting to be left alone. The tension and interplay between these two concepts are illustrated in classic western movies, some of which portray “a lone cowboy [hero] riding into the sunset”8 as the iconic symbol of individualism, while others focus on settlers traveling in wagon trains, sustaining and protecting one another as members of interdependent communities.9 Are we in America cowboys or pioneers? Or maybe both? As Putnam observed, “The relative emphasis on the individual and the community in American culture has varied over . . . periods of time, a pendulum swinging irregularly from one pole to the other and back again.”10 This swinging is, in part, a reflection of the fact that, depending on their definition and composition, communities can lead to ends that are either desirable or deplorable. Overly narrow and distorted definitions of community can have devasting effects, as evidenced by the pain and suffering of Native Americans often overlooked in classic western movies. At the same time, inclusive communities can become powerful forces for improving the human condition. Martin Luther King Jr. used the concepts of a “beloved community”11 and shared morality as influential tools in his battle for equality, reminding White clergy that “we are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny.”12 Thus, how a community is defined and how it is situated are critical to both its success and its desirability. With that in mind, let me share with you my vision of the kind of community I hope we can create in this year and in coming years as we gather together in this compact society at BYU. I begin, as I often do, by reference to the Mission of Brigham Young University. As I believe most of you know, our ultimate mission “is to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life.”13 Our work is aligned with and is part of God’s work to exalt all His children,14 including all in this university community. We have a distinctive role to play in that process—an educational role. We are to “provide a period of intensive learning in a stimulating setting where a commitment to excellence is expected and the full realization of human potential is pursued.”15 In the community we hope to build, students will be stretched and challenged intellectually in ways that may not always be comfortable—but should always be faith filled—to help them realize their full potential as children of God. The mission of BYU notes that “to succeed in this mission the university must provide an environment enlightened by living prophets and sustained by those moral virtues which characterize the life and teachings of the Son of God.”16 In this educational community, we are blessed to be led and guided by prophets, seers, and revelators, who in turn lead us to the Savior and His ultimate example, which we aspire to follow. We must take full advantage of that blessing if we are to create the kind of community we seek. The rest of the BYU mission outlines the specific educational goals, which I commend to you, and then concludes with the stirring assertion that “the earnest pursuit of this institutional mission . . . will greatly enlarge Brigham Young University’s influence in a world we wish to improve.”17 At my inauguration in 2014, President Henry B. Eyring described the kind of educational community that could fulfill the charges set forth in the mission of BYU. He called it “a vibrant and determined community of learners and lifters.”18 I later described it as “a community in which all members are truly engaged in an individual and collective effort to use all their minds and faith to learn as much as they can . . . as fast as they can, with the ultimate goal of sharing insights with others to improve their lives.”19 I hope we will all renew our efforts to create that kind of “vibrant and determined community of learners and lifters” that President Eyring described. But there is a more specific challenge that we currently face. We live in a time when the pendulum that Putnam described has swung decidedly in the direction of individualism and away from any notions of community. It is an era in which we are experiencing what Elder Bruce C. Hafen called “the waning of belonging.”20 Our sense of community has lessened, and our sense of loneliness and isolation has increased. Despite an increase in the number of people with whom we have contact through social media, our innate need to be deeply connected with others is increasingly unfulfilled. Moreover, those same social media tools increasingly direct us away from any personal contact with those who disagree with or are different from us. So our society becomes increasingly polarized and increasingly angry, and more and more people feel ­marginalized—even on this campus. Thus, there is now a need to focus more specifically on creating and enhancing another kind of ­community—a community of belonging in which all members realize the full blessings that come from gathering together in “a vibrant and determined community of learners and lifters.” Creating a Community of Belonging Many of you know that at the BYU annual university conference two weeks ago, we introduced the BYU Statement on Belonging to help us address this need. The original impetus for the statement was the outstanding work of the Committee on Race, Equity, and Belonging, which was given the charge to help us root out racism on campus. However, as I stated at the annual university conference, the reach of the BYU Statement on Belonging and the accompanying BYU Office of Belonging extends beyond that important endeavor.21 I will not read each section of that statement, as I did at the annual university conference, but I would like to highlight and elaborate on a couple of key provisions. A copy of the full statement can be found on the BYU News website.22 The statement begins with two key principles that unite us. Any community must ultimately be defined most fundamentally by what its members have in common. If they don’t share anything in common, there can be no community. And on this topic at this university, the two points that most unite us may distinguish and differentiate us from many other universities. The BYU Statement on Belonging begins: “We are united by our common primary identity as children of God . . . and our commitment to the truths of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.”23 In other words, we share a common understanding of who we really are and why we are really here on earth. That common understanding is more powerful than many may appreciate. On one occasion, President Russell M. Nelson was asked how to help those struggling with a particular prevalent sin. His response was, “Teach them their identity and their purpose.”24 Elder Tad R. Callister later observed that this is “an appropriate response to most of the challenges we face in life.”25 Our understanding of our relationship with God and of His plan for us enhances not only our confidence and self-worth but, more important, our ability and desire to love all with whom we come in contact as we recognize their infinite worth and potential. United by our understanding of those and other truths of the restored gospel, “we strive to create a community of belonging composed of students, faculty, and staff whose hearts are knit together in love.”26 Our goal is to create a community of belonging involving all members of our community. As I have already noted, a sense of belonging is important to all human beings. Quoting from a report from the Mayo Clinic, President M. Russell Ballard noted at the most recent general conference: “Having a sense of belonging is so important. . . . Nearly every aspect of our lives is organized around belonging to something.” This report adds, “We cannot separate the importance of a sense of belonging from our physical and mental health”—and, I would add, our spiritual health.27 The Mayo Clinic report that President Ballard cited went on to add: The social ties that accompany a sense of belonging are a protective factor helping manage stress. When we feel we have support and are not alone, we often cope more effectively with difficult times in our lives.28 The strength and support that exist in a community of belonging are characterized in a scripture cited in the Statement on Belonging: Mosiah 18:21. In that scripture, a community of belonging is one in which the members’ “hearts [are] knit together . . . in love.” The phrase “hearts knit together in love” is interesting and significant. The heart is used in scripture as “a symbol of [our] mind and will . . . and the figurative source of all emotions and feelings.”29 The heart represents the core of who we really are. In a community of belonging, a portion of this central existential self must be willingly sacrificed to the group in ways that enlarge both our individual and community abilities. Knitting is a process whereby fabric—usually yarn—is used to create a product that consists of a number of consecutive rows of connected loops that intermesh with the next and previous rows. As each row is formed, each newly created loop is pulled through one or more loops from the prior row and placed on the . . . needle so that the loops from the prior row can be pulled off the other needle without unraveling.30 Thus, knitting involves multiple, reinforcing connections as the different loops are brought together to create one single product. Knitting is similar in some respects to weaving, which is also “a technique for producing a . . . fabric made from . . . yarn or thread.”31 But knitting is different from weaving in one significant way: “Because there is no single straight line of yarn anywhere in the pattern, a knitted piece of fabric can stretch in all directions.”32 That is not true for most woven products, which typically “only stretch along the bias.”33 “Depending on the yarn and knitting pattern, knitted garments can stretch as much as 500%. For this reason, knitting was initially developed for garments that must be elastic or stretch in response to the wearer’s motions.”34 We will need that kind of flexibility in our efforts to create a community of belonging, because knitting hearts will stretch us in ways that will challenge and test each of us. We often find ourselves exasperated when we realize we are working with less-than-perfect beings, but we too often forget that so are those who are working with us. As Elder Neal A. Maxwell put it, “We are each other’s clinical material.”35 That is both a sacred trust and a challenging test that requires and develops patience and love. But even as we are flexible and patient with others, we must remain anchored to the transcendent truths of God’s eternal plan. As anyone who has knitted knows, “if they are not secured, the loops of a knitted course will come undone when their yarn is pulled.”36 Like any knitted product, if our hearts are not secured to God and His truths and commandments, the entire knitting project may quickly and completely unravel. Let me suggest three things we can do to secure the knitting that has already occurred and also accelerate the pace of the knitting that remains to be done to create a community of belonging in which hearts are united in love. First, let us strive to view others first as children of God. Our initial inclination as fallen individuals is to view those in front of us primarily by their gender, race, political affiliation, sexual orientation, economic class, or other distinguishing features. Those identities can be important from time to time, but all of them are secondary all the time. Our failure to constantly remember that is the cause of many unnecessary wounds and tears in the knitted product. We would do well to keep in mind the profound observation of C. S. Lewis, who once stated: It is a serious thing to live in a society of possible gods and goddesses, to remember that the dullest and most uninteresting person you can talk to may one day be a creature which, if you saw it now, you would be strongly tempted to worship. . . . There are no ordinary people. You have never talked to a mere mortal. . . . It is immortals whom we joke with, work with, marry, snub, and exploit.37 If we were to view those with whom we disagree through this lens, it would not only elevate the tone of the discussion but would also improve the quality of decisions that are made. More important, it would change the overall environment and soften hearts in ways that would make them more suitable for knitting. Second, we should think more in terms of the “we” and less in terms of the “I.” Usage of these pronouns can be very telling. As Putnam explained: Use of “we” is more common in strong marriages and close-knit teams. . . . Similarly, high-status, confident people, focused on the task at hand, not on themselves, use fewer “I” words.38 One of many factors that Putnam used as evidence that the pendulum has shifted away from communitarianism to individualism is the growing use of the first-person singular pronoun I relative to the use of the first-person plural pronoun we. Using Google’s n-gram search engine, which measures the number of times a word has appeared in the historical Google Books archive over time, Putnam found that “from 1900 to 1965 the word ‘I’ appeared less and less often in American publications, but after 1965 . . . that trend reversed itself.”39 Usage “of the word ‘I’ in all American books actually doubled between 1965 and 2008.”40 Because we are immersed in that kind of individualized cultural environment, it will take conscious effort to create a sense of community that focuses not just on ourselves but also on others. If we strive to think more in terms of “we” and less in terms of “I,” we might more often take into account how our words and actions impact not only us but also those around us. We might profitably ask ourselves more often, “Does this action really contribute to the creation of a belonging community, or does it simply create more divisiveness?” The answers to that question will not always be easy. But consideration of that inquiry will help create a belonging environment in which all feel welcomed and loved. The apostle Paul provided an example of how consideration of the impact on others might positively alter the decisions we make each day. In 1 Corinthians 8, Paul addressed the question of whether the Saints could eat meat that had been sacrificed to idols. He noted that since “we know that an idol is nothing in the world,”41 it really didn’t matter whether one ate the meat or not. Because those to whom he was writing understood that eating the meat did not necessarily indicate support for idol worship, Paul concluded that they could eat the meat without causing any harm at all to themselves. He wrote, “Neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse.”42 However, Paul indicated that, for him, there was another factor to consider. He worried that his actions might negatively affect those who did not have the same understanding about idols and that, seeing him eat the meat, they might think that idol worship was proper. And for Paul, the potential impact of his actions on others dictated his personal choice. Conceding that he could eat without harm to himself, Paul nevertheless refrained, stating, “If meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth.”43 Our ability to create a true community of belonging with our hearts knit together would be greatly enhanced if we were to similarly consider the impact of our words and actions on the lives of others who we might unwittingly lead astray because they lack the same knowledge and context that we possess. Third, and above all else, we must trust God. Because knitting hearts requires molding into one the individual wills and hearts of each member of a community, it requires abilities beyond those of the most skilled human surgeon. In the end, it is a task that only God can perform. Knitting our hearts together requires that we trust Him completely with the one thing that is uniquely ours: our will.44 That kind of supreme sacrifice requires supreme trust in Him. And because the process is individualized and involves other people, the immediate results may not be what we expected. Indeed, at times they may seem counter to the end we are seeking. In such situations, which seem increasingly frequent in the swirling circumstances in which we find ourselves, we must allow God to work in His way and on His timetable. I heard a story this week that illustrates this well. It concerns a visiting pastor who attended a breakfast in the middle of a rural farming area. The group had asked an older farmer, decked out in bib overalls, to say grace for the morning breakfast. “Lord,” the farmer began the prayer, “I hate buttermilk.” The visiting pastor opened one eye to glance at the farmer and wondered where this was going. The farmer then loudly proclaimed, “Lord, I hate lard.” Now the pastor was growing concerned. Without missing a beat, the farmer continued, “And Lord, you know I don’t much care for raw white flour.” The pastor once again opened an eye to glance around the room and saw that he wasn’t the only one feeling uncomfortable. Then the farmer added, “But Lord, when you mix them all together and bake them, I do love warm, fresh biscuits. So, Lord, when things come up that we don’t like, when we don’t understand what You’re saying to us, help us to just relax and wait until You are done mixing. It will probably be even better than biscuits.” He then said amen. When we find ourselves frustrated by events, by actions of others, or even by our own actions, let us remember that if we trust God and His goodness, things will work out in the end—even if the individual ingredients are not initially very appealing to us. The followers of Alma whose hearts were knit together in love came to that blessed state when they were gathered together in a compact, proximate society in a land called Mormon. Their experience there caused them to revere that place. As recorded in Mosiah, “The waters of Mormon, the forest of Mormon, how beautiful are they to the eyes of them who there came to the knowledge of their Redeemer.”45 I hope that because of our efforts to create a community of belonging, we may one day say, “The campus of BYU, the mountains of BYU, and the buildings of BYU, how beautiful are they to the eyes of them who there came to the knowledge of their Redeemer as their hearts were knit together in love.” May this be our goal and destiny is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen. <start> The development of empathetic thinking and feeling that a legal education can promote may contribute to the development of our ability to love as the Savior loves and to truly possess charity, a central and essential celestial attribute. What a pleasure it is to be with you this evening. It feels like I am back home. While I value all of our programs at the university, I will openly confess that the Law School holds a special place in my heart. It is a place that has greatly shaped my life, both as a student and as a faculty member. The Mission of BYU Those who have followed my tenure as president know that my focus from the outset has been on the mission statement of the university, a foundational document approved by the BYU Board of Trustees in 1981. It sets forth the key principles that guide the university. Many of you will be familiar with the first sentence of the mission statement, which indicates that, in its broadest sense, our mission as a university “is to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life.”1 We are to provide what President Spencer W. Kimball called an “education for eternity,”2 an education that, in the language of The Aims of a BYU Education, is “(1) spiritually strengthening, (2) intellectually enlarging, and (3) character building, leading to (4) lifelong learning and service.”3 A quick review of the mission statement makes two things very clear: First, our primary focus is on teaching ­students. That may seem obvious. You may think that every university focuses on teaching students; that is why they exist. That is true. But at many universities the size of BYU, the focus on teaching students is counterbalanced against an emphasis on faculty research, with students sometimes relegated to coequal or even secondary status in some decisions. While research is an important part of what happens at BYU, various features of the mission statement remind us that students must remain the central priority. For example, the word students appears in the mission statement seven times. The word faculty appears twice. The word administrators appears only once. Although I am quite confident that the authors of the mission statement did not engage in a careful word count to ensure that the relative importance of each group was precisely represented in the numeric ratio, the relative use of each term serves as a reminder that our mission focuses on the ­students—and not on the faculty or anyone else. Second, consistent with the emphasis on students, the vast majority of the mission statement focuses primarily on undergraduates and what they should learn. The description of the type of education students are to receive is geared primarily to undergraduates. According to the mission statement, students are to receive a broad general education with in-depth learning and instruction in a selected major field.4 In other words, they are to receive a traditional liberal arts and sciences undergraduate education. Our enrollment numbers reflect that same undergraduate focus. We have approximately 33,000 full-time students, of which 30,000 are undergraduates; only 3,000 are graduate students. At many major universities the balance is much closer to 50/50 or in some cases is even weighted more heavily in favor of graduate students. Thus the mission statement makes clear that BYU is primarily an undergraduate teaching institution, not a graduate research institution. The only reference to graduate programs in the mission statement is in a single phrase indicating that research should be encouraged among both faculty and students, “including those in selected graduate programs of real consequence.”5 Given that undergraduate emphasis, one might ask, What is the role of the Law School in fulfilling the mission of BYU? This is a question I first began to ask myself when, as dean of the Law School, I realized that I was the only dean on campus who had absolutely no undergraduates in my college—not necessarily a comfortable position at a university whose primary focus is on undergraduates. So as I sat in Deans Council, I began to ask myself, How does a purely graduate program like the Law School fit in a place like BYU? This evening I would like to offer some thoughts on that question. What can—and should—be the role of a law school at a university like BYU, whose clear focus is on undergraduate learning? Or, to use the terminology of the mission statement, what does it mean to be a graduate program “of real consequence” at BYU, and does the Law School fit that definition? Law Schools in America’s History The question of how a law school should fit into the larger university is one that has been debated for much of America’s history. Although the early European universities included law as one of the central subjects to be studied,6 at the time of the American Revolution most lawyers entered the profession via an apprenticeship.7 Legal education was simply not a feature of most universities at the time.8 That trend continued through the nineteenth century as well. Most lawyers in the 1800s began the practice of law without ever attending law school. They became lawyers the way Abraham Lincoln did, by reading the law part-time. Today’s first-year law students may contemplate with envy the scene described by one of Lincoln’s friends: the future lawyer-president learned his craft by sitting under an oak tree reading law books day after day, moving around the tree to keep in the shade.9 That sure beats sitting in a sterile classroom, waiting fearfully to hear the sound of your name called by professors who seem to expect you to already know what you thought they would teach you. By the end of the nineteenth century there were law programs at a number of universities. Still, an 1891 report found that only one in five lawyers admitted that year had been to law school, and no state required law school attendance as a condition of admission to the bar.10 Moreover, even where there were law schools there were serious questions about whether they belonged in a university. Many academics in other fields viewed legal education as vocational training, an endeavor they considered beneath the dignity of institutions dedicated to the lofty ideals of a liberal arts education. The second-class status of early law programs within their universities was demonstrated by the fact that, in 1901, “opponents of Georgetown’s athletics program were irritated to discover [that] a disproportionate number of Georgetown’s athletes [were] enrolled in the law school.”11 In the eyes of many, law school courses were the “underwater basket-weaving classes” of their time. The relatively low esteem in which law schools were held is furthered illustrated by the fact that no one thought it odd that future Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black was not accepted into the college of arts and sciences at the University of Alabama in 1904 but was admitted without difficulty to that university’s school of law that same year.12 Summarizing the views of many academics at the time, Thorstein Veblen asserted in 1918 that “the law school belongs in the modern university no more than a school of fencing or dancing.”13 This thinking slowly changed as legal education moved toward a graduate school model. At the beginning of World War I, only two law schools—at Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania—required undergraduate degrees as a condition of admission.14 Others began to impose that requirement but essentially provided open enrollment to anyone with a college degree, often failing out a large number of students after admission.15 Yale led the way toward selectivity by limiting its class size to 100 students in 1926 and, in 1928, becoming the first school to require an aptitude test in addition to a college degree.16 Over time law schools became more selective and more academic, and as a result they began to gain greater stature within the university system. Today most universities with law schools proudly point to them as examples of excellence within the university. I think few, if any, quibble about whether law schools belong at a university. One reason the debate ended is that, over time, law schools became profit centers for their universities. Because the faculty-student ratio in law school is so much higher than that of most graduate programs and because legal research does not require expensive labs or equipment, law schools cost much less per student than most graduate programs, and they typically produce excess revenues that they share with the university. It is easy to welcome as a member of the university a program that regularly generates revenue for the university. By that monetary measure, law schools have generally been “of real consequence” to their universities for quite some time. However, the recent dramatic decline in law school applications may alter the way universities think about their law schools. As enrollments, and therefore revenues, decrease, some universities now find themselves in the position of subsidizing their law schools. My guess is that the term “of real consequence” may be used in quite a different way in conversations between those law schools and universities today. The Law School’s Role at BYU Fortunately, because of BYU’s unique funding model—under which basic funding is provided by our sponsoring Church—tuition does not provide the major source of funds for either the Law School or the university. As a result, the Law School’s role at the university has never been defined in financial terms. At BYU we must look for some nonmonetary definition of what it means to be a graduate program of real consequence. Key insights into what elements might be included in that definition at BYU come from a speech given by President Marion G. Romney at the dedication of the Law Building in 1975. President Romney was one of the prime movers in the establishment of the BYU Law School. Thus it was appropriate, and instructive, for him to explain, in his words, why he “used such influence as [he] had” to establish the Law School.17 President Romney gave several reasons, three of which I want to highlight tonight. First, he said, “I have long felt that no branch of learning is more important to an individual or to society than law.” Second, he said, “I further felt that the educational base at Brigham Young University—the flagship of our Church educational system—would be and should be broadened by the establishment of a law school.” Third, he said, “I likewise felt that the atmosphere of honor, integrity, patriotism, and benevolence prevailing at Brigham Young University would be a good influence upon a law school and its student body.”18 The latter two reasons seem particularly relevant to my topic because they directly address the relationship between the university and the Law School, so I will begin with those. But, as I will explain later, I believe that the first reason also sheds clarifying light on why we could consider this law school a graduate program “of real consequence” at BYU. With respect to the second and third reasons identified by President Romney, I note the focus on both the impact the Law School could have on the university and the impact the university could have on the Law School. President Romney seemed to envision a symbiotic relationship in which each entity would be helped by cooperating with the other. In the interest of time, I will not describe in much detail the things the university can do to enhance the Law School, but let me point out one thing by way of instruction and advice for the law students here. The language President Romney used to describe the positive impact the university would have on the Law School is interesting. He said it was “the atmosphere of honor, integrity, patriotism, and benevolence prevailing at Brigham Young University [that] would be a good influence upon a law school and its student body.”19 It is the atmosphere—the environment, not some specific university program or service—that would benefit the Law School and its student body. I don’t know exactly what President Romney had in mind, but when I think about the atmosphere that prevails among the undergraduates at BYU, I picture the thousands of eighteen- to twenty-year-olds in the freshman class I greeted just today. They are extremely optimistic, enthusiastic, and, yes, maybe a little naïve. But they radiate goodness and warmth. And I hope that their optimism and enthusiasm are a bit contagious. The study of law can breed cynicism and pessimism. And although you need to advance beyond the level of the somewhat clueless naïveté that afflicts some of the undergraduates on our campus, I hope you follow Elder Bruce C. Hafen’s important admonition to “view things not only with [your] eyes wide open but with [your] hearts wide open as well”20 and “to be as childlike as [your legal] education has taught [you] to be tough-minded.”21 If you find yourself becoming too jaded, too cynical, and too combative—or if others find you that way—I urge you to wander across the rest of campus or attend a student performance or a devotional and soak in the refreshing and rejuvenating atmosphere that these wonderful undergraduates help create on campus. Your life and the lives of your loved ones will be much better in law school if you do. Helping the University Accomplish Its Mission With that observation and invitation, let me now turn to the other part of President Romney’s vision: what the Law School can do to help the university accomplish its mission. As I noted, the primary focus of the university is on our undergraduate students. One might think that, as a solely graduate program, the Law School might have little or no impact on that portion of the student body. But that is not the case. In his most recent annual report to the university, Dean D. Gordon Smith outlined three ways in which the Law School directly enhances the educational experience of our undergraduates. First, in the past few years Law School faculty members have developed and taught undergraduate classes—such as Brigham Daniels’s course on environmental policies and Justin Collings’s course on the history and workings of the U.S. Supreme Court. Second, some Law School faculty have also responded to the university’s emphasis on undergraduate mentoring by involving undergraduates in their research projects. For example, this last year Dean Smith, David H. Moore, and D. Carolina Núñez employed thirteen BYU undergraduates in their Law and Corpus Linguistics Project. Another twenty-four undergraduates provided more than 1,300 hours of volunteer time on that project. Third, law faculty have also been increasingly involved in interdisciplinary work with other faculty members on campus. These collaborations are developing into faculty “clusters,” which lie somewhere between completely informal and ad hoc collaborations to more formal ongoing research and curriculum projects. Clusters have developed on such topics as law and entrepreneurship—with professors Curtis Anderson, Clark D. Asay, Stephanie P. Bair, A. Christine Hurt, and Matthew Jennejohn as well as Dean Smith joining faculty from the Marriott School of Management—and there is a cluster on opportunity and development in which David Moore, Carolina Núñez, and Michalyn Steele are working with faculty from Political Science and Sociology to address issues involving economic and other development in underserved areas. This outreach to undergraduates and undergraduate programs should never become the principal focus of the Law School. The Law School’s primary role is, and needs to remain, to provide an excellent legal education to our law students. But these examples demonstrate that the recent changes to the west entrance of the Law School are symbolic of a larger movement connecting the Law School to the rest of the university. The Law School has, over the years, also made a disproportionate contribution to university leadership. The thirty-six full-time faculty members at the Law School constitute less than 3 percent of the more than 1,400 full-time faculty members at the university. Yet three of the six BYU ­presidents—50 percent—who have served since the Law School opened its doors forty-three years ago have been Law School faculty members. In that same time period, law faculty members have also served in the university administration as provost, associate academic vice president (two of them), assistant to the president, and faculty athletic representatives to the NCAA (again, two of them). Numerous other faculty members have headed up important committees or other endeavors at the university. Kent D. Syverud, the president of Syracuse University and a former law dean at two other law schools, observed that this is because “law school . . . is genuinely a group of people who are problem solvers, and [they] can be deployed on problems across the university.”22 Dean James R. Rasband often described a law degree as a degree in leadership.23 While one may question the quality of the current university leadership, BYU provides ample evidence of the truth of that observation. The Law School has provided extraordinary leadership to the university and will continue to do so. The Law School also has a positive impact on the university in a number of other less direct but often equally important ways. To cite one example, one of the great challenges currently encountered by religiously affiliated universities, including BYU, is the dramatic increase in regulations that create pressure for those universities to abandon some of their religious norms in order to accommodate other values. In many cases a religious university’s ability to continue to pursue its own distinctive vision of education and life will ultimately depend on the extent to which religious liberty is recognized and enforced as an important legal and cultural norm in American society. The Law School again has a disproportionate role in helping the university in that regard. The work of the International Center for Law and Religion Studies has an enormous positive impact on the entire university in that respect, not only because of the influence it has on the development of legal norms throughout the world but also because of the relationships it creates with other scholars and religious liberty advocates, who often become key allies in matters directly affecting the university. Less obvious are the contributions made by the Law School itself in dealing with such sensitive issues. For a variety of reasons, the Law School is often the first unit in the university to face the challenges that arise when our religious values conflict with other norms. And the positive and productive way the Law School has handled those matters provides guidance to the university on how to work through such issues. In those endeavors the Law School has also built relationships of trust with external entities and developed expertise that the university can draw on when it faces those same issues. There is a good reason why former Law School dean James D. Gordon III heads up the accreditation efforts of the university. I daresay that no one on campus has thought as deeply about or had as much experience with such important and sensitive issues as has Jim. That expertise and experience alone would be of enough value to qualify the Law School as a program of real consequence for the university. There are other indirect benefits that the Law School provides to the university, some of which are even less obvious. As one example, let me return to President Romney’s observation about what impact he hoped the Law School would have on the university. The language President Romney used to describe that impact might be a bit surprising to those familiar with the nature of most graduate programs. He indicated that “the educational base” of the university “would be and should be broadened by the establishment of a law school.”24 If asked to describe the purpose of most graduate programs, few academics would use the word broaden. Deepen maybe—but not broaden. Most graduate programs require students to narrow their focus—to become more specialized—so they can study the narrower subject more in depth. There is some truth to the old saying that as one ascends the academic ladder from an associate’s degree to bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral degrees, students learn more and more about less and less until they know everything about nothing. Yet President Romney chose the word broaden. He may have simply been indicating that by adding another program to the university, the university’s educational offerings would be expanded. But I suspect that President Romney, who was very careful in the language he used, intended to convey something more significant than that self-evident truth. I believe he was saying something about a distinctive and extremely valuable aspect of a graduate legal education. Dean Rasband articulately made a similar point in his remarks to entering law students, as recorded in the latest edition of the Clark Memorandum: If you consider the nature of most graduate education, its purpose is to narrow your field of vision and train you as an expert in a particular field, the classic example of which is a dissertation on a narrow subject on which no one else has written. The study of law, by contrast, is designed to broaden your field of vision and equip you with the tools to make judgments across the full range of human experience.25 Legal education is different from most other graduate programs. It is not a more focused study of topics already covered in the undergraduate years. It is a new way of approaching problems, a new way of thinking about matters, even a new, empathetic way of thinking and feeling about people. A graduate program that aims to broaden one’s horizons, to start anew after finishing college, contributes to the mission of the university by providing a living reaffirmation of BYU’s commitment to lifelong learning—learning not just in a particular topic but on every topic. And at BYU that kind of lifelong learning is especially important. In describing the broad general education we hope to provide our undergraduate students, the mission statement contains an important introductory phrase explaining the reason why a broad education is important to us. It reads, “Because the gospel encourages the pursuit of all truth, students at BYU should receive a broad university education.”26 We don’t provide a broad general education for our students just so they can be well versed enough to be interesting company at dinner parties and receptions. Our educational goals go well beyond that. We are helping prepare students for a postmortal life in which they can know all things. Having a graduate school that focuses on broadening rather than narrowing things provides a powerful reinforcement of that message. It makes clear that the broadening form of learning that is at the heart of our general education requirements should not, and does not, end with the receipt of a bachelor’s degree but extends into one of our most visible graduate programs and even beyond that. That more amorphous but potentially longer-lasting contribution of the Law School to the university’s mission underscores another significant role the Law School can play in helping the university achieve its main goal—the goal of assisting “individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life.” Assisting in the Quest for Perfection and Eternal Life In the long run, our primary purpose as a ­university is to help our students acquire the knowledge, attributes, and character that will enable them to realize their full potential as “a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents” with “a divine nature and destiny.”27 We do not provide all they need to attain that lofty status. Ultimately, the full realization of that goal requires adherence to the key principles of the plan of salvation, including receiving saving ordinances, making and keeping sacred covenants, and adhering to the other commandments that God has given us. Most of all it is dependent on our accessing the enabling, sanctifying, and transforming powers that Christ makes available to us through His great atoning sacrifice. The university cannot accomplish those things, but I believe there is still a role for it to play in that celestializing process for all our students, including law students. We are to “provide a period of intensive learning,”28 not just in abstract principles of temporal knowledge but also in actual character and skill development. Earlier in my life I believe I had misconceived the full purpose of our mortal experience. In my undergraduate years I thought of life as a longer version of an academic course—“Earth 101,” if you will. The primary purpose of the course was to learn enough from life’s experience to pass the final exam. And once that happened—once we graduated to the next level of our existence—we could forget what we had learned in this life, just as I quickly forgot much of what I had learned while cramming for a test once the final was over. Over the years I have come to appreciate that God effectively and efficiently uses this mortal period of our existence not just to test our ability to survive in this fallen world with all its challenges but also to help us develop the skills and attributes that will enable us to realize our full potential in the next life—to develop what I have come to call celestial skills and attributes, those characteristics that celestial beings possess. Most of those characteristics are developed by adherence to the commandments with which we are all familiar. But I believe that God in His economy also provides us with opportunities to develop celestial skills in our day-to-day lives and that skills we might think are valuable only in helping us succeed in our temporal affairs are actually celestial skills that we will use in the next life. To use one example, I believe that the ability to counsel with councils is a skill set that will not only help us in our temporal affairs in this mortal existence but is one that we will continue to use—and will need to perfect—if we are to be exalted. I suggest that some of the skills we learn and develop in law school may be celestial skills. As I mentioned, the skill of lifelong learning is not just an aid in making ourselves interesting and interested through our retirement years. It is a celestial skill that we will need to acquire if we are to be like God. I don’t think Brigham Young was exaggerating when he said, “When shall we cease to learn? I will give you my opinion about it: never, never.”29 Brigham Young also observed, “We do not expect to cease learning while we live on earth; and when we pass through the veil, we expect still to continue to learn and increase our fund of information.”30 Lifelong learning, an attribute law school helps us develop, is—in my view—a celestial attribute. I think there are other celestial skills law school can help us develop. For example, it seems to me that the ability to frame and use questions—a skill widely practiced and modeled in law school—is a skill we may readily employ in the next life. Elder Marlin K. Jensen eloquently explained this in a Law School graduation speech a few years ago: The use of . . . interrogatories by a loving and wise Heavenly Father guides us. The technique enables him to raise relevant issues, to encourage our thoughtful analysis of them, and then to leave us to the exercise of our agency to act. It sounds almost lawyerlike; but I would prefer to describe the process as godlike.31 Similarly, legal education should enhance our ability to empathize with others, to see things from their vantage point, and to understand more fully how they think and feel. Those are skills that help lawyers in the practice of law, but they are also skills that have eternal significance. Let me share what I observed in a different setting: While the traditional study of law emphasizes the utilitarian importance of tolerating the views and differences of others, the laws of God require it as a manifestation of our love for God and His children.32 The development of empathetic thinking and feeling that a legal education can promote may contribute to the development of our ability to love as the Savior loves and to truly possess charity, a central and essential celestial attribute.33 My guess is that there are other celestial skills that this law school can help you develop. That may be one of the many meanings behind President Romney’s assertion that “no branch of learning is more important to an individual or to society than law.”34 If we follow President Romney’s challenge to learn the laws of man “in the light of the ‘laws of God,’”35 we might discover that there is more glorifying light in a legal education than we may have supposed. And so I end where I began, with the university mission statement. Let me suggest that, contrary to what I might have implied or expressed earlier, that document has more application to the Law School and the Law School experience than may appear at first glance. Even though graduate programs are not its main focus, the key components of the mission statement—especially our desire to “provide a period of intensive learning” to assist students “in their quest for perfection and eternal life”—are fully applicable to all BYU students, including—and maybe especially—BYU law students. In that, if in no other way, the Law School provides a graduate experience of real consequence. We may not know all the ways in which the Law School contributes to that mission, but I am confident that just as the Lord is “well pleased that there . . . be a school in Zion,”36 He is well pleased that there be a law school in that school. I firmly believe that in the process of time we will come to view with greater appreciation—and maybe even reverence—the role the Law School plays both in influencing a world we wish to improve and in preparing souls for the world to come. May it be so is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen. <start> President Kevin J Worthen shares insights on how we should act despite outside influences. Welcome to our university conference. It is obvious that while the timing of this event and the subsequent commencement of classes next week follow a long-standing traditional pattern, much of the coming school year and even the format of this program will be quite different from what we have come to expect. Some of those differences are the result of preplanned improvements and some are the result of the coronavirus pandemic. To use the scriptural phrase in 2 Nephi 2, we have “both . . . act[ed] and . . . [been] acted upon”1 during this past year. And the result is that this year is much different from previous years. The dramatic nature of these differences, as well as their two major causes—acting and being acted upon—are illustrated by the two most distinctive features of the setting in which we find ourselves this morning. I am presenting from a platform different from the traditional stand and podium we have used for this meeting in the past. You are sitting—well, I don’t know exactly where you are sitting, but it is clearly not in the Marriott Center, where we usually gather. The first difference is a result of our acting: it is a preplanned innovation that we debuted on March 10, when Steven M. Sandberg presented his moving devotional on forgiveness.2 The latter change was introduced the very next week, on March 17, when Elder Jack N. Gerard gave an equally ­impressive devotional on trusting God3 to a completely empty Marriott Center because of concerns about the coronavirus pandemic—a clear example of being acted upon. In the intervening week between those two devotionals, the world changed dramatically for everyone in our campus community. In a period of only five days, we completely changed the mode of instruction for almost every class and rethought and reconfigured almost every service we offer on campus to make it safe for both our students and our employees to accomplish what they set out to do despite the devasting effects of the worst pandemic of our lifetime. Overcoming the Challenges Let me once again thank each of you for your part in what I can only describe as a miracle—an ongoing miracle that continues to this day as so many have worked so hard and so diligently to prepare for the return of our students to what is still a unique and precarious environment. Your monumental actions provide definitive proof that we can act even while being acted upon and that, because of Christ’s atoning power, in the long run the impact of our actions can overcome all things that act upon us.4 Because that is one lesson I hope you take away from my message today, let me repeat it: We can act even while being acted upon, and because of Christ’s atoning power, the impact of our actions can overcome all things that act upon us. Celebrate and Be Reenergized The changes that have occurred on campus over the last five months are so monumental that many of us mentally divide our prior year’s BYU experience into BC (Before COVID) and AC (After COVID), with March 12—the date on which we announced we would shift to remote ­instruction—as the dividing line. That is both understandable and natural. However, if we overly emphasize that divide, if we remember and judge this past year solely by the dramatic changes that occurred beginning March 12, we may deprive ourselves of the full blessings, joy, and progress that God intends us to derive from our experiences this past year. Let me give a couple of instructive examples. First, if we focus solely on how significantly things have changed since March 12, we may miss the opportunity to celebrate and be reenergized by the numerous accomplishments that occurred last year, many of which happened before March 12. Last year was an amazing year in that regard. Just to cite a few examples of our students’ successes, students from the Marriott School of Business took first place in at least five different competitions. [A picture was shown of the winners of the International Business Model Competition: Zoia Ali, Abby Warner, and Taimi Kennerley.] Students from the BYU animation program—which is a collaboration between the College of Fine Arts and Communications and the College of Physical and Mathematical Sciences—won their sixth Student Academy Award for their short Grendel. Students from the animation program also made history by winning first place in two categories at the Intel University Games. Their video game Avast Ye received first place for both best game play and best visual design, making them the first team to win two first-place prizes in the same year. Examples of achievements can be found in other aspects of the university operations. Construction on the new Westview Building commenced prior to March 12 and was completed after that date. It is now ready to be occupied. The last phase of our Heritage Halls living facilities has also been completed. And approval was given and construction has begun on a new music building. In athletics, the men’s cross-country team won the NCAA national championship, and the women’s cross-country team took second in their national championship event. The women’s ­soccer team advanced to the Elite Eight round of the NCAA tournament. At the end of the fall 2019 season, BYU was ranked fifth in the Learfield IMG Director’s Cup standings, which measure overall success among the more than 350 NCAA Division 1 programs. The men’s volleyball team finished its season ranked number one in the nation, and the men’s basketball team was ranked sixteenth in its final poll. In both cases their seasons were truncated by the pandemic. That rightly gives them and us cause for some lament. But please do not let us focus so much on what might have been that we miss out on the joy and strength that comes from celebrating what was—and is. In that regard, let me note that in a typical year, the stand at this conference is filled with recipients of various university awards. This year we are recognizing forty-seven individuals for their unique and outstanding service to the university. Each has demonstrated exceptional competency and sacrifice in their work. I honor each of them and express my personal appreciation to them. While we are unable to have them join us here in this meeting because of our circumstances, I hope you will take time to read about them in upcoming YNews articles and in the university ­conference awardee booklet that will be available online at the conference website. I urge each of you this week and in following weeks to take some time in your own departments and units to recognize the accomplishments of this past year—and don’t limit them to events in the After COVID era. Celebrate and recognize even the good things that were interrupted by the arrival of the coronavirus in Provo. The recognition that your God-given power to act produced good fruit before the pandemic can strengthen your faith that He will grant you the necessary power to act and overcome the challenges that will arise during and after the pandemic. Celebrating the past can help us remember that, because of Christ’s atoning power, the impact of our actions can overcome all things that act upon us. “Be Not Weary in Well-Doing” Second, too much focus on the Before COVID/After COVID divide may both unnecessarily ­discourage us and keep us from fully realizing our remarkable potential as a university. If we view the world solely through the Before COVID/After COVID lens, we may erroneously conclude that we have only two long-term choices. On the one hand, we could hunker down and weather the storm with the hope that when it is over, we can pick up the surviving artifacts of the pre–March 12 world and piece them back together in a way that will enable us to return to our prior unaltered plans—surviving, but otherwise unaffected by the pandemic experience. Alternatively, we could conclude that the pandemic is such a disruptive force that we should jettison all our prior plans and traditions and accept a new normal that is so radically different from our pre–March 12 days that what we did before is automatically suspect and in need of replacement. In short, overemphasizing the divide between the pre- and post-pandemic world may cause us to wrongfully believe that eventually we will have to either ignore the present, hoping it goes away quickly, or ignore the past, hoping it never returns. In my view, both those options are less than optimal. Fortunately, neither is inevitable. I believe that if we fully engage, process, and remember the experiences of this present pandemic world, we can bring together the past and the present to make a better future. I hope that we do not just survive this unusual experience but that we lean into it in a way that both reconfirms the essential components of our prior core goals and also accelerates our progress toward them. That is admittedly a very ambitious, audacious—and some would say unrealistic—aspiration. But I believe that we are better positioned than any other university to do this—that we were, if you will, built for this. The theme of this conference provides a key for how we can achieve this lofty goal. The theme comes from Doctrine and Covenants 64:33: “Be not weary in well-doing, for ye are laying the foundation of a great work.” That verse contains both an admonition and a motivating reason for following that admonition. Both are especially relevant in the COVID world in which we currently find ourselves. The admonition is very simple: “Be not weary in well-doing.” That advice seems tailored specifically to the situation in which we find ourselves. It is so easy to become weary in this very uncertain COVID world in which everything seems to be dynamic and fluid and in which projections change overnight. The term “COVID fatigue” has now entered our lexicon. It is used to describe a number of different phenomena,5 and several different causes of the varying conditions have been identified. But surely one of the principal components of COVID fatigue is the seemingly ubiquitous uncertainty that surrounds almost every decision we are currently dealing with.6 It is difficult—and incredibly draining—to work in an environment in which you do not know if the plans you are so carefully creating will be effective or even possible. And it is still more enervating to repeatedly see that your work is undone by unexpected developments, sometimes even before the task is started. We are—and have been—operating in what cognitive psychologist Robin M. Hogarth calls a “wicked” learning and decision-making environment,7 one in which there are no obvious patterns and, as described by David Epstein, “feedback is often delayed, inaccurate, or both.”8 It is easier to work in what Hogarth calls a “kind environment,”9 in which, Epstein said, “patterns repeat over and over, and feedback is extremely accurate and usually very rapid.”10 That definition of a kind decision-making environment may describe much of what we did day-to-day before March 12, but it is clearly not what most of us have been dealing with since. It is hard to operate in a wicked environment because, as Hogarth has pointed out, there is so much uncertainty and misinformation that reliance on one’s prior experience often leads to exactly the wrong conclusion with disastrous results.11 Operating in that type of environment for long can be exhausting—unless one has both a higher vision and a higher, more accurate source of feedback. And this is where the second part of our scriptural theme comes into play. The Lord’s admonition that we “be not weary in well-doing” is accompanied by a statement that is both an explanation for why we should not be weary and a motivation for avoiding that mindset. We should not—and need not—be weary because we “are laying the foundation of a great work.” We are engaged in an endeavor that is of enormous import. And it is a work that is not ours alone but also God’s. If we truly believe that, as our mission statement declares, our task “is to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life,”12 we should proceed with full confidence that our work is not only essential but God directed and God supported. That understanding will provide the most compelling motivation for not becoming weary in well-doing. We can be assured that, notwithstanding our current circumstances, God will give us the knowledge and ability to act in ways that will overcome all the effects of being acted upon. Aligning Ourselves with the University Mission Some might suggest that given the significant nature of the changes that have occurred, we should dramatically revise or even abandon our mission statement to adapt to the “new normal.” I believe that would be a serious mistake. We are—and have been for our entire history—engaged in a work that is enduring, even ever­lasting. We are laying a foundation for the eternities, not erecting a tent for temporary shelter. The first objective is to “ensure alignment with the university mission.”The second is to “enhance the educational experience of our students,” knowing that the shape of that educational experience is outlined in the mission statement and in the aims.The third is to expand enrollment—to make this mission-aligned, enhanced education available to more students. With that in mind, let me briefly review at a high level the things we have been working on in the past few years—and that we will continue to work on in the next few years, notwithstanding the pandemic. These come from the strategic five-year plan that we have developed as a President’s Council. There are three main strategic objectives. Each is grounded in specific provisions of the ­mission statement and aims of a BYU education: There are several more layers of details associated with each of these three strategic objectives. Let me share just the next level so that you can see in a bit more detail what I believe we should continue to focus on even as we adjust to and emerge from the pandemic. There are four major aspects of the effort to align ourselves with the university mission: First, we want to ensure that all our hiring processes focus not just on the secular skills required but also, and more important, on mission fit. Second and third, we need to ensure that our teaching and learning is “faith-based” and our research and scholarship is “student-centered.” I have attempted to describe what those two terms mean in prior university conference addresses that I believe are still relevant.13 Fourth, we want to promote a sense of belonging among all members of the campus community. In that regard, let me thank and acknowledge both the members of our university Committee on Race, Equity, and Belonging and those involved in similar efforts in the various colleges and other units on campus. Both gospel principles and our mission statement commit us to developing “a loving, genuine concern for the welfare”14 of all of God’s children, regardless of their race, gender, sexual orientation, or other distinguishing feature, each of which is secondary to our common identity as “beloved spirit son[s] or daughter[s] of heavenly parents.”15 For our second strategic objective, in order to enhance the educational experience of our students, we will continue to focus on inspiring learning, on expanding and enhancing experiential learning opportunities, and on improving classroom instruction. We will also continue working to improve access to limited enrollment programs and to develop BYU Online classes. To achieve our third strategic objective, we will continue to work on our plan to offer our enhanced educational experience to more students by expanding enrollment by up to 3,000 more full-time students over a six-year period. I should report that it appears we may have started out at a more accelerated rate than we had intended this year because of the early entry of a number of missionaries whose service was interrupted by the pandemic. But, as with most things, we will be able to make the necessary adjustments while continuing to stay on course. We will have a chance to discuss both our progress and our plans in each of these areas more in depth in the coming months. But I think it is helpful that we clearly communicate at the start of this academic year our intention to continue to focus on our pre–March 12 priorities. What was important before that date remains important today. However, as I stated earlier, that does not mean that our plan is to batten down the hatches and wait out the storm, hoping to emerge unaffected. This COVID experience, like all our mortal experiences, can and should help us improve.16 If we emerge from the pandemic unscathed but unchanged, we will have missed out on the full benefit of this unique experience. Making Our Classroom Experiences Come Alive Let me give just a few quick concrete examples of ways in which our ability to achieve our pre–March 12 goals may be enhanced by the pandemic experience we are going through. You will recall that one of the ways we have been working to enhance the educational experience of our students is through the continued development of BYU Online. As many of you know, BYU Online courses are designed not to provide online degrees or programs to those who can never come to our campus but rather to enhance the education of our on-campus matriculated students by helping them become lifelong online learners and providing them with increased scheduling flexibility. It also frees up classroom space to help with our expanded ­enrollment plans. We first began the BYU Online program as a pilot eight years ago, relying primarily on college and department volunteers. After seven years we had reached the point last fall semester in which we offered 101 courses with 249 sections, which resulted in just more than 11,000 enrollments. Following the sudden change to remote delivery on March 12, there has been increased interest in quality online options among colleges and departments as they have seen the ways in which student learning can be enhanced by online courses designed at the outset for that kind of experience. As a result, this coming fall semester we are offering 136 BYU Online courses with 415 sections, resulting in more than 26,000 enrollments in BYU Online courses. As you will see, that represents a 35 percent increase in the number of courses, a 67 percent increase in sections offered, and a 130 percent increase in the number of enrollments in the past pandemic year. I seriously doubt our BYU Online offerings would be nearly as robust in either number or quality without the pandemic. This does not mean that we will move to a system in which online learning becomes the exclusive or even primary means of instruction or that we will abandon other modes of instruction that are equally important to “the balanced development of the total person”17 to which our mission statement commits us. But this aspect of our efforts to enhance the learning experience of our students has clearly been accelerated by our post–March 12 experience. I believe that experience will also improve our in-person classroom teaching, which is a key component to the faith-based teaching and learning we hope occurs here. As a result of the involuntary shift to remote instruction, I believe most faculty will be more adept and more comfortable in using technology to enhance learning even in the in-person classroom setting. I believe many already—and more will in the future—think more deeply about how they present material in a classroom setting. If all we do in a classroom is deliver a pre-scripted lecture, we must now surely ask ourselves if we need to meet in person or if there is something else that could be done in what we now realize is extremely precious and limited face-to-face classroom time. The pandemic experience should make us more willing and able to try new things and to connect more effectively with our students in ways that enhance and deepen their understanding of the subjects we are teaching. Let me provide an example of an effort that was going on before last winter semester, before the pandemic, that illustrates the kind of creativity I hope our post–March 12 experience causes us to consider more frequently. [The video “Restoration Class Projects Inspire Creativity, Build Faith”18 was shown.] Now our current circumstances prohibit us from gathering together in that kind of crowded environment you saw in the video, but I am convinced that if we think carefully and receive inspiration, we will be enlightened as to ways in which we can make our classroom experience come alive as we think again about how we use that very ­precious time. Adapting and Moving Forward with Faith I also believe that our pandemic experience can help us reach our goal to promote a greater sense of belonging among all members of our campus community. I hope the physical and geographical separation that the pandemic has forced upon us will give us greater appreciation of the benefits we can all derive from our relationships with others, especially those whose backgrounds are different from our own. If we reflect on the loneliness almost all of us have felt at times these past five months because of physical separation, I hope we will all be quicker to look for and reach out to those who experience that loneliness even when they are surrounded by people. I also hope that the less frequent interaction we have experienced since March 12 will cause us to be more kind, more patient, and less quick to judge; that it will focus us more on others rather than on ourselves; and that we will be more committed to demonstrating, in the words of our mission statement, “a loving, genuine concern for the welfare of our neighbor,”19 even in doing things as small and simple as wearing a face mask in public buildings and other places in which the safety of others might be compromised. Finally, this pandemic has provided us with a remarkable opportunity to increase our ability to deal with uncertainty. As I noted before, the pandemic may present the most “wicked” learning and decision-making environment that most of us have experienced in our lifetimes. However, I am confident it will not be the last time we encounter such a situation. Many—including one of our forum speakers next winter semester, David Epstein20—have concluded, even before the pandemic, that we are living in “a rapidly changing, wicked world.”21 The ability to adapt and move forward in such settings is increasingly important in today’s society. And we can provide opportunities for our students to learn this skill in a wide variety of settings. A good illustration of this is in the following video, which shows how photography professor Paul Adams helped students learn how to adapt to new ideas using an old technology, which was for them fraught with all kinds of uncertainty. [The video “Vanishing Voices Inspire BYU Photography Project”22 was shown.] Making a tintype image is a process that is very unforgiving and exacting. You have to get the mixture right in terms of coating the plate. You have to keep people still for a long period of time, and if there is a flaw, it comes out. It is there forever. It is sort of a wicked environment for these students. And the mixture of the chemicals themselves is flammable. The students involved in this project not only learned how to produce tintype images—which, as the video showed, led directly to one graduate’s current job—but they also developed the critical skill of dealing with the uncertainty inherent in using what for them was an entirely new and foreign method of photography, a skill that will serve them well regardless of the occupation they choose or the photographic equipment they will use. More important, as Elder Bruce C. Hafen has noted, learning how to deal with uncertainty and especially learning how “to understand and live with competing true principles [are] essential skill[s]”23 in our eternal development. One of the purposes of this mortal existence is to learn to proceed with faith even in the face of great uncertainty when there is no guarantee—other than God’s word—that things will work out for our good. If we can learn to deal with such uncertainty and “ambiguities with a believing attitude,” Elder Hafen said, “our faithful choices will lead ultimately to our sanctification.”24 Thus, learning how to deal with the unexpected and unpredictable—such as a coronavirus pandemic—will not only prepare our students to “be capable of meeting personal challenge and change,”25 as a portion of our mission statement provides, but it can also help them achieve “the full realization of human potential”26 that another portion of that statement requires us to do. Our challenge, therefore, is not just to survive the pandemic but to learn from it by acting with faith, even in the face of uncertainty, and trusting that God can truly make “all things . . . work together for [our] good,”27 as He has said. We have a legacy in this Church of meeting such challenges. Let me share one simple example from our history. From the earliest days of his arrival in the Salt Lake Valley, Brigham Young focused on building a temple. It was one of his primary goals. After years of work, progress began to be made, but then other events—events that no doubt caused the Saints to feel acted upon—came into play. Our former colleague Richard O. Cowan described one of those events this way: On July 24, 1857, as the Latter-day Saints were celebrating the tenth anniversary of their entrance into Salt Lake Valley, they received the . . . disturbing news that a potentially hostile United States army was approaching Utah. Not knowing the army’s intentions, Brigham Young had the temple foundation covered with dirt as a precaution. When the army arrived the following year, Temple Square looked like a freshly plowed field, and there was no visible evidence of the temple’s construction. As it turned out, the army marched through Salt Lake City without harming any property and set up its camp some thirty miles to the southwest, near Utah Lake. Even during the years when the army was in Utah, draftsmen in the architect’s office were busy planning the exact size and shape for each of the thousands of stones that would be needed for the temple. With the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, the army was needed elsewhere, and it departed from Utah by December of that year. The foundation was uncovered in preparation for work that would resume the following spring.28 Now at this point the Saints had survived their version of a pandemic. But they did it while continuing to focus on their temple-building ­“mission” by doing the work the best they could under the circumstances. Once the threat was gone, they returned to the task with eagerness. However, something was different. Professor Cowan continued: At this time, President Young examined the newly uncovered foundation and became aware that it was defective. He and his associates noticed large cracks and concluded that its small stones held together with mortar could not carry the massive weight of the temple. On January 1, 1862, he announced that the inadequate foundation would be removed and replaced by one made entirely of granite. The footings would be sixteen feet thick. “I want to see the Temple built in a manner that it will endure through the Millennium,” [Brigham Young] later declared.29 Now I am certain that Johnston’s Army was not a welcome sight to the Saints in 1857. They may have viewed it as a threat not unlike a pandemic. Their first instinct was just to survive. But they resisted that and continued to work on their prior plans as best they could. And when the danger was gone, they found new insights that allowed them to build an even better and longer-lasting temple. Would they have discovered the cracks in the foundation if their work had not been interrupted by the army? I do not know. But I do know that they emerged from a crisis with a better foundation because they did not abandon the project. They learned that they could act even while being acted upon and that because of Christ’s atoning power, the impact of their actions could overcome all things that acted upon them. Although I have focused primarily on the traditional educational processes led by our outstanding faculty in the examples I have provided, there is a role for everyone and every unit to play in this process, including our academic support units. And their role is not limited to providing indispensable support to the academic colleges and departments. As amazing as those support efforts have been in the past five months—and they have been magnificent—the efforts of our academic support units in the central part of educating our students in a variety of ways have been equally impressive. The results may not be as widely known, but for some of our students, they are as eternally significant. Let me highlight just one of many examples. This example shows what has happened with a student employee in BYU Publications and Graphics. [The video “Inspiring Learning: Brent Standley”30 was shown.] What a great example of inspiring learning—not in a classroom, not in a course, but through employment in an academic support unit. That is what we hope can happen everywhere on campus before, during, and after the pandemic. I thank and love each of you for what you contribute to our mission, especially in these trying times. I do not think any university community has worked harder, more diligently, or more cooperatively than has ours to allow our students to gather in a safe way to learn in an atmosphere of faith the lessons of eternity that are available here. I should acknowledge that no matter how hard we have worked, things will not all go according to plan. We will have to adjust. It is possible that we will have to abruptly return to remote ­delivery—and maybe early in the semester. But we will continue to focus on the essentials outlined in our mission statement, confident that we are laying the foundation of a great work and that as we act righteously even as we are acted upon, we will, with God’s help, succeed because this is part of His work that will not fail. I witness that God lives. He has a perfect plan for His children—for each one of us. Because of the atoning sacrifice of His Son, Jesus Christ, Christ has the power to make all things right. And this is part of His work at this university. I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen. © Brigham Young University. All rights reserved. If we choose to view events in our lives from the eternal perspective that emanates from an understanding of God’s eternal plan of salvation, our lives will be happier and more productive, and we will have greater strength to meet the challenges that will inevitably come our way. One of the most noticeable features of our ­valley is the Y on the mountain to our east. The Y’s expanse is so large and its presence so imposing that the mountain itself is named Y Mountain. The connection of the letter on the mountain to the history, purpose, and mission of the university is so deep and established that many refer to the university itself as simply “the Y”—a reference that continues to confound the alumni of Yale University. I hope that for today’s graduates, the Y on the mountain will serve as a reminder of the knowledge they have gained, the things they have done, and the persons they have become during their time at BYU. I also hope it will serve as an ongoing invitation to them to add to the impact of what some call the spirit of the Y—a spirit of service and character that emanates from not just the intellectual dexterity but also the spiritual strength that they have acquired here. The Letter Y That is a lot to expect from a simple letter of the alphabet, and especially one that struggled a bit to make it into and remain a part of our modern English alphabet. The letter y was introduced into the Roman alphabet—from which ours is derived—around AD 100,1 long after most letters had already arrived there.2 The letter y performed much the same role as the Roman letter i, which had made its way into the Roman alphabet 800 years earlier.3 The original function of the y was to allow the adaptation of Greek words into Roman writing.4 Thus it was called Y or I or E Greek—or i griega, for those who speak Spanish—as a reminder that it was not native to the Roman alphabet. Since it largely played a role already occupied by another letter of the alphabet, the letter y has always had a bit of a tenuous position. At least one modern linguist still decries the letter y as a “luxury . . . , or rather a great nuisance,” whose presence would not be missed and whose absence would simplify spelling rules.5 Why not, some ask, spell cycle, syllabus, and dynasty with an i instead of a y? But, despite its critics, the letter y has endured—sometimes only by means that seem serendipitous. At one time the Roman alphabet contained the letter thorn (þ). It was pronounced “th,” as in the words this, then, or the.6 While it performed a function quite different from that of the letter y, the lowercase thorn appeared similar to the lowercase y. “Over time, as Gothic script was introduced to Old English, ‘Y’ and ‘thorn’ looked too similar—and one had to go.”7 Unfortunately for the letter thorn, French printers did not have the letter thorn in their printing images in their presses, “and it became common to replace the ‘thorn’ with a ‘y.’”8 Thus signs in England began to read “Ye Old Fish and Chips Shop” and not “The Old Fish and Chips Shop,” and the letter thorn faded into obscurity. So, but for the peculiarities of French printers in the distant past, the mountain to our east might have looked like the letter thorn—and our university might have been known not as “the Y” but as “the Thorn.” The Y Left Standing by Itself The Y on the mountain has its own inauspicious origins. Its roots trace back to a rivalry between two classes of students only three years after Brigham Young Academy became a full-fledged university—a time when both Brigham Young University and Brigham Young High School shared the same space. It was not unusual in those days for a class to mark its graduation by leaving symbols on the landscape. In the spring of 1906, the junior class at the high school decided to get a jump on the process and at the same time demonstrate its superiority to the senior class by etching a large ’07 on the mountainside, referring to the year in which they would graduate in the future. Not surprisingly, upon awakening to that sight, the senior class objected. One contemporary account described the reaction with dramatic flair: The Student Body . . . sprang to its feet in angry ­amazement; the whites of its eyes gleamed like lightning. Its generals . . . ran to the four winds with flaming banners, and crying: “Assemble, ye hosts, prepared to fight!”9 There then ensued “an all-day mountainside altercation,”10 with punches exchanged on both sides. BYU president George H. Brimhall and BY High principal Edwin S. Hinckley assembled a group, and a decision was made to have all the classes join together to put the letters B, Y, and U on the mountainside.11 The project began with the letter Y to ensure that all the letters would be properly centered on the mountain.12 Measurements and calculations were made both on the mountain and at the old Academy Building (which is now the Provo City Library) to make sure the letter would appear centered and proportioned from the perspective of those in the valley. On an appointed day, the work began to construct the Y with lime, rock, and sand. As one participant described it: The students stood in a zig zag line about 8 feet apart stretching from the bottom of the hill to the site of the Y. The first [person] took the bag of lime, sand, or rocks and carried it 8 feet and handed it to the second [person]. The second carried it another 8 feet and handed [it] to the third [person], and thus the bag went up the hill.13 The group started in the early morning with the expectation that the job would be completed by 10 a.m.14 But the task proved much bigger than the group had thought. By midafternoon some students had fainted and had to be carried off the hill, and it was 4 p.m. before the Y was finally thinly covered.15 The effort was so exhausting that, in the words of one involved, “no attempt was made to cover the other two letters,”16 and the Y was left standing by itself. The Positive Spirit of the Y So one might say that the Y on the mountain is the result of fisticuffs and fatigue. Hardly the kind of motivational origins that one would choose to inspire the heart, notwithstanding the allure of the alliteration. And yet there is in that history, like the somewhat tenuous history of the letter y, two brief interrelated lessons that I offer as my advice to the graduating class today. First, symbols such as the letter y or the Y on Y Mountain ultimately gain meaning in our lives not so much because of their physical shape or presence but because of what we choose to make of them. Likewise, the meaning of events in our lives will be determined not so much by the events themselves but by how we choose to view and respond to them. And that in turn is shaped dramatically by the perspective from which we choose to view both the symbols and the events in our lives. Given its late arrival, its limited role, and at times even its tenuous place in the alphabet, some choose to view the letter y as a “nuisance,” but I, for one, delight in words such as yes, yearn, young, and even yikes—not to mention yawn, which many of you may be doing now. Similarly, given its origins, I suppose some could view the Y on the mountain as a symbol of conflict and exhaustion. However, I—and I believe most of us—choose to view it as a symbol of unity and energy, and that positive image has been reinforced by our actions over the years. If we choose to view events in our lives from the eternal perspective that emanates from an understanding of God’s eternal plan of salvation, our lives will be happier and more productive, and we will have greater strength to meet the challenges that will inevitably come our way. All that depends on how we choose to view things. Even with that more positive perspective, there will be times when you will feel overwhelmed by events—times when despite your best efforts you will fall short of your goal, when you will feel that you have utterly failed—just like the exhausted students must have felt when the B and the U were left off the mountain. But, as it turns out, having only a Y on the mountain may have been the optimum result, even though few, if any, might have thought so at the time. After all, as our own Peter B. Gardner observed in his BYU Magazine article a few years ago, “‘Lighting the BYU’ just doesn’t have the same ring to it”17 as does the phrase “lighting the Y.” And would we really prefer a “Bee-wy-yoomount Terrace”?18 The second lesson, therefore, is that in times when you feel like you have failed, that nothing is going right, and that there is nothing that can be done about it, you can—and I pray that you will—trust God’s remarkable promise that He can make all things work together for the good of those who love Him. I testify that this remarkable promise, found in Romans 8:28 and repeated throughout modern-day scripture,19 is true. You may not see it immediately, but God can make all things work together for your good. He can turn an altercation between rival classes and a failed attempt to stamp a mountain with three letters into a symbol of unity and success. More important, He can make good come from all our efforts—not just from our successes but also from our failures and the failures of others that cause us pain. God is that good and that powerful. We just need to trust Him. So as you look at the Y on the mountain, I hope you see hope, optimism, and faith in the future. I congratulate you graduates on your achievement and pray you will be uplifted by the positive spirit of the Y in all your endeavors. And I offer that prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen. <start> I urge you to view things from an eternal perspective—in the light of God’s great plan of salvation. As you do so, your past, present, and future will be more meaningful, more fruitful, and more joyful. Graduation is a time for celebration. It is also a time for calibration. We therefore look backward and forward. We recognize and applaud the past accomplishments of the nearly 6,000 of you who will be awarded degrees this day. At the same time, we encourage you to consider the future and where you are headed. As you focus on both the things that have happened in the past and the choices you face in the future, it is important that you consider both from an eternal perspective and that you try to fit isolated events and decisions in your life into a broader, larger picture. The importance of doing so is suggested by a story from the book The Once and Future King by T. H. White. The book is about the legendary King Arthur of England. The first part of the book focuses on the education Arthur received as a young boy and, especially, the training he received from Merlin, the magician who helped prepare Arthur for his future kingship. Merlin used a variety of means to teach these lessons to Arthur. On one occasion, he told Arthur the story of Elijah and the rabbi: This rabbi . . . went on a journey with the prophet Elijah. They walked all day, and at nightfall they came to the humble cottage of a poor man, whose only treasure was a cow. The poor man ran out of his cottage, and his wife ran too, to welcome the strangers for the night and to offer them all the simple hospitality which they were able to give in straitened circumstances. Elijah and the Rabbi were entertained with plenty of the cow’s milk, sustained by home-made bread and butter, and they were put to sleep in the best bed while their kindly hosts lay down before the kitchen fire. But in the morning the poor man’s cow was dead. . . . They walked all the next day, and came that ­evening to the house of a very wealthy merchant, whose hospitality they craved. The merchant was cold and proud and rich, and all that he would do for the prophet and his companion was to lodge them in a cowshed and feed them on bread and water. In the morning, however, Elijah thanked him very much for what he had done, and sent for a mason to repair one of his walls, which happened to be falling down, as a return for his kindness. The Rabbi . . . , unable to keep silence any longer, begged the holy man to explain the meaning of his dealings with human beings. “In regard to the poor man who received us so hospitably,” replied the prophet, “it was decreed that his wife was to die that night, but in reward for his goodness God took the cow instead of the wife. I repaired the wall of the rich miser because a chest of gold was concealed near the place, and if the miser had repaired the wall himself he would have discovered the treasure. Say not therefore to the Lord: What doest thou? But say in thy heart: Must not the Lord of all the earth do right?”1 The point of the story is twofold: First, we can best judge things that have happened in our lives if we view them from God’s ­perspective, from an eternal viewpoint. When we have soul-stretching experiences, we should consider them in light of God’s plan for us, with the assurance that even though we don’t fully understand things when they happen, God can make “all things work together for [our] good” if we love Him.2 That should reassure us about both our past and our present. The more we understand His perspective and His plan for us, the more we realize that He is more mindful of us than we may be aware. Second, understanding the bigger picture can help us make better choices for our future. Looking beyond the immediate impact of our choices to the eternal perspective will help us have greater joy and satisfaction in life. Let me give you an example that may be particularly relevant to you graduates at this point in your life. There are a variety of paths you may pursue in the immediate future, ranging from graduate school to full-time parenting. But most of you will, at one point in your life, spend many of your waking hours at work. There are a wide variety of occupations that will be available to you for that phase of your life. You may be tempted to make a decision about which job you take based mainly on the income and prestige it will generate. This has some allure, but I urge you to consider a more eternal perspective in choosing what kind of work you do, and, even more important, I urge you to consider an eternal perspective in choosing how you do whatever work you choose. Professor Martin E. P. Seligman has noted that some scholars have identified “three kinds of ‘work orientation,’” or three ways of looking at your work: as “a job, a career, and a ­calling.”3 He explained that the differences among the three depend both on how well your work matches up with your skills and, more important, how you view the endeavor. A job, he observed, is something you do . . . for the paycheck at the end of the week. You do not seek other rewards from it. It is just a means to another end (like leisure, or supporting your family), and when the wage stops, you quit. 4 A career, however, entails a deeper personal involvement in work. You mark your achievements through money, but also through advancement. Each promotion brings you higher prestige and more power.5 Thus you will have more success and more enjoyment if you view your work as a career instead of just as a job. But even that orientation has its limits. Seligman suggested: When the promotions stop—when you “top out”—alienation starts, and you begin to look elsewhere for . . . meaning.6 The highest level of orientation, according to scholars, is what Seligman referred to as a calling or a vocation, which is a passionate commitment to work for its own sake. Individuals with a calling see their work as contributing to the greater good, to something larger than they are. . . . The work is fulfilling in its own right, without regard for money or for advancement. When the money stops and the promotions end, the work goes on.7 The work orientation you have depends more on how you view what you are doing than on what you are doing. As Amy Wrzesniewski put it: A physician who views the work as a job and is simply interested in making a good income does not have a calling, whereas a garbage collector who sees the work as making the world a cleaner, healthier place could have a calling.8 Make your work, whatever it may be, a ­calling or a vocation—not just a job. Finally, remember that as important as it is to view your work from an eternal perspective, it is even more important to understand that in the long run, your most important work is as a family member—as a wife and mother, husband and father, daughter and sister, son and brother. I recently heard a remarkably accomplished man tell about how decades after it had occurred, his children remembered very distinctly that he had missed an event important to them because he had to attend to some business matter. He noted that while his children could remember very well exactly what event he had missed, he had long since forgotten what seemingly more important business ­matter he had chosen to attend instead. President Harold B. Lee repeatedly taught: “The most important . . . work you will ever do will be within the walls of your own homes.” We must never forget that.9 As we celebrate your past accomplishments and look forward to your future, I urge you to view things from an eternal perspective—in the light of God’s great plan of salvation. As you do so, your past, present, and future will be more meaningful, more fruitful, and more joyful. May it be so is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen. <start> Joy is the key to our spiritual survival in the trying times in which we live, as well as in the trying times that lie ahead of us. During this past October general conference, two members of the Quorum of the Twelve, Elder D. Todd Christofferson and Elder Neil L. Andersen, shared the exact same quote from a talk given by President Russell M. Nelson in the October 2016 general conference,1 when President Nelson was serving as president of the Quorum of the Twelve. Although it is always good to follow the counsel of prophets, seers, and revelators, I have learned to pay particular attention to those instances in which more than one of them focuses on the same topic—or, as in this case, the exact same words—at the same time. My desire to carefully reread President Nelson’s 2016 talk increased when I noted that Elder Dale G. Renlund also cited that same talk in his October 2019 general conference address.2 Clearly these brethren had been reading President Nelson’s October 2016 talk. Clearly, I thought, I should do the same. President Nelson opened his October 2016 talk by stating that he was going “to discuss a principle that is key to our spiritual survival.”3 I thought, “No wonder Elders Christofferson, Andersen, and Renlund referenced the talk.” President Nelson then upped the ante by adding, “It is a principle that will only become more important as the tragedies and travesties around us increase.”4 Now he had my full attention: “a principle that is key to our spiritual survival” and one “that will only become more important as” our challenges increase. What was that principle? President Nelson introduced the principle by reviewing the life of Lehi as recorded in the Book of Mormon. Lehi was persecuted, mocked, and even physically threatened because of his belief in God and his desire to keep God’s commandments. He left behind the comforts of home to go out into an unknown wilderness because of his commitment to God. He suffered hunger and other deprivations. Some of his sons rebelled against him. His was not an easy life. President Nelson summed up Lehi’s life in terms that may sound a bit like your life at times: “Clearly, Lehi knew opposition, anxiety, heartache, pain, disappointment, and sorrow.”5 President Nelson also noted that, in these trying circumstances, “Lehi taught a principle for spiritual survival”6 by declaring “boldly and without reservation a principle as revealed by the Lord: ‘Men are, that they might have joy.’”7 There it is. Joy is the key to our spiritual survival in the trying times in which we live, as well as in the trying times that lie ahead of us. When we experience “opposition, anxiety, heartache, pain, disappointment, and sorrow”—things all of us are likely to face in this coming year—how are we to survive? By tapping into the power of joy. Experiencing “a Fulness of Joy” I believe we often underestimate the importance of the concept of joy. Without much thought, we sometimes casually wish others a joyous holiday season or invite them to spread joy. But I am not sure we fully appreciate how central joy is to God’s plan for us. And it seems that our current leaders, from President Nelson on down, are now trying to draw our attention to it. In fact, according to a word search on the Gospel Library app, the word joy was used 149 times in this most recent general conference—more than double the sixty-five references in the April 2019 conference and nearly triple the fifty-four references in the October 2018 general conference. To use the current social-media parlance, joy was clearly trending in this last general conference. And the trend goes beyond general conference. The December 2019 issue of the Ensign and Liahona magazines focused on the concept of joy. Elder Patrick Kearon, a General Authority Seventy, quoted President Nelson’s talk on joy in his remarks at the First Presidency Christmas devotional just four weeks ago,8 as did Sister Jean B. Bingham in her recent BYU devotional talk here at the Marriott Center.9 Add to that Elder David A. Bednar’s BYU devotional last December,10 which focused on joy, and it is clear that joy is one of the principles that current Church leaders want us to consider more deeply. So my request for this coming year is that we focus more on joy; that we seek to understand it better; that we come to view it not just as a mental or emotional concept or feeling of comfort but as a principle of power—power to survive and thrive spiritually and otherwise; and that we come to experience what President Nelson has called “enduring joy.”11 So we begin by asking, “What is joy?” That is not a simple question. It is a question that philosophers, psychologists, songwriters, theologians, and poets have explored and debated for millennia. Part of the difficulty is that language is a little imprecise and ultimately inadequate to capture the concept fully. For example, some distinguish happiness from joy, although in scriptures and prophetic teachings those terms are sometimes used interchangeably. However, this much seems clear: joy is not merely a temporary emotion but rather a more permanent and constant condition. As stated in the Guide to the Scriptures, joy is “a condition of great happiness coming from righteous living.”12 It is not some momentary sensation of rejoicing but a condition—a state of being. King Benjamin described it this way: Consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God. For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if they hold out faithful to the end they are received into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of never-ending happiness.13 President Dallin H. Oaks explained it this way: Joy is the ultimate sensation of well-being. It comes from being complete and in harmony with our Creator and his eternal laws. The opposite of joy is misery. Misery is more than unhappiness, sorrow, or suffering. Misery is the ultimate state of disharmony with God and his laws. Joy and misery are eternal emotions whose ultimate extent we are not likely to experience in mortality. In this life we have some mortal simulations, which we call happiness or pleasure and unhappiness or pain.14 Notice three common elements in King Benjamin’s and Elder Oaks’s descriptions: 1. In its fulness, joy is a condition or state of being; it is a constant. 2. It comes from living in harmony with God’s laws, from keeping His commandments. 3. We may not experience it fully in this life. Indeed, because of the limits of our mortal bodies and finite minds, we likely cannot even fully describe or understand this condition. As President Nelson noted, God “offers an intensity, depth, and breadth of joy that defy human logic or mortal comprehension.”15 In fact, the scriptures indicate that we can completely experience “a fulness of joy” only after resurrection, when our perfected bodies and spirits are “inseparably connected.”16 Thus joy is in one sense a description of our ultimate destiny. Joy is at the center of God’s plan for us. The book of Job recorded that when that plan was presented to us in the premortal existence, we “shouted for joy.”17 Note that the scripture indicates we shouted for joy and not with joy. It may well be that we were not just generally rejoicing at the announcement of the plan but rather were celebrating the concept of joy itself, shouting for joy, overwhelmed at the beauty and depth of the concept of joy and our realization that we, too, might enter into that state of being that our Heavenly Parents enjoyed. As Joseph Smith put it, joy or “happiness is the object and design of our existence.”18 Joy is the very purpose for which we, and everything else in the cosmos, were created. Thus it should be no surprise that it was the “good tidings of great joy”19 that the angel pronounced to the shepherds at Jesus’s birth. However, just because we may not completely experience a fulness of joy in this life, it does not mean that we are without joy in the world. Adam and Eve both recognized that their choices in the Garden of Eden made it possible that “in this life [we] shall have joy,” even “the joy of our redemption.”20 Indeed, one of the purposes of this life is to develop our capacity for joy—and the extent to which we do that will impact the degree to which we will experience joy both in this life and even more in the world to come. As Elder Jack H. Goaslind once observed, “Our joy in God’s kingdom will be a natural extension of the happiness we cultivate in this life.”21 Thus Moroni taught that our level of joy does not automatically change with death. When the Judgment comes, he wrote, “he that is happy shall be happy still; and he that is unhappy shall be unhappy still.”22 Thus, even though we may not experience a complete fulness of joy until the next life, it is very much in our interest to do what we can to experience all the joy we can in this life—both because it will make our current lives better and because it will better prepare us for our ultimate destiny to experience the fulness of joy that God wants to share with us. So how do we do that? How can we cultivate more joy in our lives now and thereby increase our capacity to experience joy in the next life? Let me share six suggestions. Cultivating More Joy in Our Lives First, we need to recognize, and constantly remember, that our ability to have joy in this life—and in the eternities—is not dependent on external conditions. As President Nelson so eloquently put it: The joy we feel has little to do with the circumstances of our lives and everything to do with the focus of our lives. When the focus of our lives is on God’s plan of salvation . . . and Jesus Christ and His gospel, we can feel joy regardless of what is happening—or not happening—in our lives.23 This is the quote that Elders Christofferson and Andersen cited in their most recent general conference talks. This is the quote that Elder Kearon shared in the Christmas devotional and that Sister Bingham shared in her most recent BYU devotional. It is so contrary to what many in the world think—and that erroneous thinking diverts us from joy—that it bears repeating: The joy we feel has little to do with the circumstances of our lives and everything to do with the focus of our lives. When the focus of our lives is on God’s plan of salvation . . . and Jesus Christ and His gospel, we can feel joy regardless of what is happening—or not happening—in our lives. This is not a mere abstract concept. It is to be taken literally. President Nelson made this clear: For example, it doesn’t seem possible to feel joy when your child suffers with an incurable illness or when you lose your job or when your spouse betrays you. Yet that is precisely the joy the Savior offers. His joy is constant.24 This is what President Nelson invites us, as well as all the world, to experience—what he calls “enduring joy”—joy that can exist even when we fail a test, feel rejected, or face ridicule. It is a joy that does not need to wait until midterms, finals, or any other unpleasant task is over before we feel it. True joy, even the somewhat diluted but still overwhelming25 brand we can experience in this life, transcends our circumstances. So don’t wait for your circumstances to change before experiencing an increase of joy. Draw on the power of joy in every situation. Second, we should recognize and remember that enduring joy—constant joy—does not mean uninterrupted bliss and a life free of challenges. Suffering and adversity are part of the eternal plan, a part of the process by which we come to develop enduring joy. Joy helps us transcend temporary trials; it does not eliminate them from our lives. As Elder Lawrence E. Corbridge recently noted, “Suffering and joy are not incompatible but essential companions. You can suffer and never know joy, but you can’t have joy without suffering.”26 Even God, who is the very essence of joy, experiences sorrow. As recorded in Moses 7, God weeps over the wrong choices of His children and over their resulting, unnecessary sufferings.27 But, at the very same time, He comforts those who join in that sorrow by instructing them to “lift up your heart, and be glad,”28 because those who embrace His plan “shall come forth with songs of everlasting joy.”29 So don’t let Satan fool you into thinking that you are failing in your quest for joy because you have tough days. All of us do. Satan wants us to be miserable like unto him,30 and one way he strives to do that is by discouraging us into thinking that the challenges and difficulties we experience are the result of our own inadequacies and prove that we are not worthy of joy. But many of life’s events are beyond our control. We may struggle with mental health issues or be radically affected by the inadvertent, or even intentional, misdeeds of others, or maybe we just struggle because of the vicissitudes of life. If so, we should not blame ourselves or think ourselves beyond God’s reach. Instead we should recognize that with the Savior’s help, we can still experience joy—even in the midst of our afflictions. As President Nelson explained, because of Christ “we can feel joy even while having a bad day, a bad week, or even a bad year!”31 When you experience the inevitable challenges that lie ahead, believe in God and believe that He is concerned for you individually. He will weep with you, even as He bids you to “lift up your heart, and be glad.” And when you are struggling, do not overlook the positive impact that you can have on others even while you are feeling inadequate. You are probably doing much better than you think, and others around are uplifted even when you are struggling inwardly. I often meet with distinguished visitors to campus. Many of them are struck by the joy they feel radiating from the students on campus. They labor to describe what they feel as they mingle with students, and they search for words to explain why they feel it. One such visitor asked me if we had “a happiness initiative” on campus. I responded that we did not, that it was just the natural disposition of our students. I am sure that not every student this visitor met was having the best day ever; some, I am sure, were struggling. Yet they still radiated joy that uplifted this visitor—and many others. I realized later that I had missed a wonderful missionary opportunity. When I was asked if we had a happiness initiative, I should have said, “Yes. It is called the plan of happiness. Would you like to learn more about it?” Third, recognize and remember that true joy, enduring joy—the joy that many visitors to campus sense—ultimately comes only through keeping God’s commandments. Remember, King Benjamin indicated that joy describes “the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God.” Indeed, the commandments are the guidelines or the requirements for experiencing enduring joy.32 As Joseph Smith explained: Happiness is the object and design of our existence; and will be the end thereof, if we pursue the path that leads to it; and this path is virtue, uprightness, faithfulness, holiness, and keeping all the commandments of God.33 It is only when we live in accordance with celestial law that we are able to experience celestial joy. As section 88 of the Doctrine and Covenants makes clear, “For he who is not able to abide the law of a celestial kingdom cannot abide a celestial glory.”34 And one of those commandments is to love our neighbors35 and to demonstrate that love through serving them, whether it be through formal ministering assignments or just through simple deeds of kindness for a roommate or a stranger. Focusing on the well-being of others increases our joy, regardless of our external circumstances. As Elder Goaslind once observed, “One key to maintaining your happiness in spite of adversity” is to follow Christ’s commandment to lose our lives for the sake of others.36 It is concern for the well-being of others that gives God joy.37 It is in following Him and His example that we will experience that same fulness. President Nelson summed up the connection between joy and keeping the commandments with this very practical, but powerful, observation: Every time we nurture our spouse and guide our children, every time we forgive someone or ask for forgiveness, we can feel joy. Every day that you and I choose to live celestial laws, every day that we keep our covenants and help others to do the same, joy will be ours.38 Fourth, because we will not in our mortal state keep the commandments perfectly, repentance is a critical part of experiencing enduring joy. Many in the world, and too many in the Church, view repentance as an unpleasant, even dreaded process, confusing the consequences of failing to repent with repentance itself. However, as Elder Christofferson explained, just the opposite is true: When prophets come crying repentance, [some say] it “throws cold water on the party.” But in reality the prophetic call should be received with joy. . . . Repentance is a divine gift, and there should be a smile on our faces when we speak of it. . . . Rather than interrupting the celebration, the gift of repentance is the cause for true celebration.39 One stake president wisely observed that “if we really understood the doctrine of repentance, we would run to repent.”40 Reflecting this same understanding, one of my Church colleagues confided in me that one of his goals was to be in the Repentance Hall of Fame. This does not mean that repentance is easy or that it should be done casually. President Nelson has taught, “To repent from sin is not easy. But the prize is worth the price.”41 Repentance always stretches our souls, sometimes beyond what we think we can stand, as Alma the Younger discovered. But the joy Alma felt as a result was so great that, once he had experienced it, he “labored without ceasing, that [he] might bring [other] souls unto repentance; that [he] might bring them to taste of the exceeding joy of which [he] did taste.”42 So if we want to experience joy, we need to repent—and to even repent joyfully. Because, as President Nelson observed, “when we choose to repent, we choose to . . . receive joy—the joy of redemption.”43 Fifth, we need to recognize and remember that joy is a principle of power. Joy is not just a reward for a lifetime effort to follow God’s commandments and to repent when we fail. Joy can increase our ability to stay on the covenant path that leads to enduring joy, to do things we might not otherwise be able to accomplish. As President Nelson explained, “Joy is powerful, and focusing on joy brings God’s power into our lives.”44 As proof of this truth, President Nelson pointed to the example of the Savior, “‘who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross’ [Hebrews 12:2]. Think of that! In order for Him to endure the most excruciating experience ever endured on earth, our Savior focused on joy!”45 Similarly, we can bring God’s power into our lives by focusing on joy. President Nelson asked: If we focus on the joy that will come to us, or to those we love, what can we endure that presently seems overwhelming, painful, scary, unfair, or simply impossible? . . . . . . What repenting will then be possible? What weakness will become a strength? What chastening will become a blessing? What disappointments, even tragedies, will turn to our good? And what challenging service to the Lord will we be able to give?46 Sixth, and finally, all of this is possible only because of Jesus Christ. President Nelson summed it up: “How, then, can we claim . . . joy? We can start by ‘looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith’ ‘in every thought.’”47 Let me repeat again, with a little different emphasis, the quote that so many Church leaders have recently shared: The joy we feel has little to do with the circumstances of our lives and everything to do with the focus of our lives. When the focus of our lives is on God’s plan of salvation . . . and Jesus Christ and His gospel, we can feel joy regardless of what is happening—or not ­happening—in our lives. Joy comes from and because of Him. He is the source of all joy. . . . For Latter-day Saints, Jesus Christ is joy!48 Thus Christ is not only “the author and finisher of our faith” but is, in one sense, the author and finisher of our joy. We begin to have joy when we focus on Christ. We can then bring the power of Christ into our lives by focusing on joy. I bear witness that He lives and that because He lives, we can, in the world to come, experience the fulness of joy that is part of our eternal destiny, if we so choose. And in this life we can, through joy, survive and flourish spiritually. May we more fully experience the power of joy in the coming year is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen. <start> My admonition is that you be awful in its original, unpejorated sense—that you always be aware of things that are awe-inspiring. I am urging you to be full of awe, if you will. It is customary for speakers at a graduation ceremony to give advice to the new graduates, to share with them words of wisdom to inspire them in their next stage of life. Perhaps because such sage advice is in somewhat limited supply, much of what is said at these events has been said before and will likely be said again. With that in mind, let me give you graduates a two-part charge that I doubt you have heard in any graduation ceremony you have attended. First Charge: Be Awful The first part is a simple two-word admonition: “Be awful.” Yes, you heard right. My advice to you is be awful. You can see why I was so confident that you would not have heard this message at any prior graduations that you have attended.1 Before you dismiss my advice as a completely inappropriate effort to be unique rather than helpful, let me explain what I mean by that charge. Linguists know well that the meaning of words can change dramatically over time. One form of change is what is called pejoration. “Pejoration is the process by which a word [with a positive or neutral meaning] acquires negative connotations”2 over time. One classic example of pejoration is shown by the history of the word silly. In the ­thirteenth century the word silly meant ­“worthy, good,” and “pious, holy.”3 Over the ensuing centuries, however, the meaning changed first to “innocent” or “harmless,” then to “deserving of pity or sympathy,” to “weak/feeble,” then to “ignorant.” By the ­sixteenth century it had descended to “foolish,” its ­current meaning.4 The same thing has happened to the word awful. It too has pejorated. Centuries ago the word awful had a very positive connotation. Its original meaning was “awe-inspiring,” “worthy of . . . respect,” and “profoundly respectful or reverential.”5 But as one author explained, “Since what inspires awe isn’t always so pleasant, [over the centuries, awful] came to mean something negative.”6 The word had pejorated, linguists would say. And so today awful has come to mean “terrible, dreadful, appalling”; something not just bad but “exceedingly bad.”7 Hardly the kind of thing you would expect a graduation speaker to advise you to be. My admonition is that you be awful in its original, unpejorated sense—that you always be aware of things that are awe-inspiring. I am urging you to be full of awe, if you will. “Psychologists have described awe as the experience of encountering something so vast—in size, skill, beauty, intensity, etc.—that we struggle to comprehend it.”8 It is the kind of thing that Moses experienced when God showed him the purpose, creation, and history of this earth. Struggling to comprehend the grandeur of all he had seen, Moses “greatly marveled and wondered.”9 As a result, he came to realize things he “never had supposed.”10 He was in awe—or full of awe. Being awful in that way has its rewards. It makes life fuller, more enjoyable, and more productive. Matthew Hutson explained in a recent article in the Atlantic magazine that awe shrinks our ego. Awe makes [us] feel a greater sense of oneness with others. And this oneness can make us nicer: Researchers found, [for example], that inducing awe—[such as] by having people stand in a grove of tall trees—increased generosity. . . . Awe also shapes our sense of time. One series of studies found that awe made time feel more plentiful, which increased life satisfaction.11 Most important, experiencing awe can help us keep things in perspective. That is what happened to Moses. His vision caused him to think deeply about the grandeur of God and His plan of salvation. Moses understood things he had never even supposed before. That in turn caused Moses to have greater faith in God and in God’s plan for him. I am confident that all of you during your time here learned something that you never had supposed. It may have been an insight into a subject you were studying. It may have been the discovery of something you did not know about yourself. It may have been inspiration concerning the goodness of God and His love for you and for others around you. I hope that each of you took advantage of those opportunities to be filled with awe—to be awful. Moreover, I hope you continue to have such experiences for the rest of your life. Unfortunately, increased knowledge can sometimes diminish our ability to experience awe. President Dieter F. Uchtdorf put it this way: It seems to be human nature: as we become more familiar with something, even something miraculous and awe-inspiring, we lose our sense of awe and treat it as commonplace.12 Thus the first part of my charge is to not let your education diminish your willingness to experience awe, for there is so much in the world around us that can cause us to be full of awe. BYU professor David W. Hart stated it well in a devotional talk he gave here a couple of years ago. He said: Make an extra effort to find awe in the everyday aspects of your life and take a moment to say, “Wow!” In so doing, your senses will be heightened and, in turn, will reveal more about you as well as additional opportunities to apply your uniqueness.13 Second Charge: Don’t Pejorate; Ameliorate The second part of my two-part charge consists of a three-word admonition: “Don’t pejorate; ameliorate.” Just as words can pejorate and acquire a more negative meaning over time, words can also acquire a more positive meaning. Linguists call this amelioration. A classic example is the word nice, which in the twelfth century meant “careless, clumsy; weak; poor, needy,” but which through a series of changes over the centuries has ameliorated to mean “kind, thoughtful.”14 As each of you are now graduates from BYU, you will carry with you your good name and the good name of this university. What people think of those two names will largely depend on their interactions with you. The second part of my charge to you is that you never do anything to pejorate your name or the name of your alma mater, that you instead strive to ameliorate both. My hope is that those who encounter you and learn that you are a graduate of Brigham Young University will think better of BYU because they know you, that the term BYU will ameliorate—not pejorate—as a result of what you do and who you are. Moreover, most of us have also taken upon us the sacred name of Jesus Christ. Please do nothing to diminish the importance of that name, for “Jesus Christ is the name which is given of the Father, and there is none other name given whereby [men and women] can be saved.”15 As we are filled with awe for Him and for His works, as we act in accordance with the promptings we feel at such times, His name will not only ameliorate but will eternally be glorified by what we do. I hope you make that one of your postgraduation goals as well. So be awful. Don’t pejorate; ­ameliorate. Words to live by. May we all do so is my humble prayer, which I express in the awe-inspiring, holy name of Jesus Christ, amen.
