That WDT

1 CD
My NNP
remarks NNS
today NN
focus VBP
on IN
one CD
reality NN
about IN
that DT
quest JJS
for IN
perfection NN

It PRP
is VBZ
a DT
truth NN
that WDT
is VBZ
hard JJ
to TO
deny VB
, ,
yet RB
difficult JJ
to TO
accept VB
. .
It PRP
is VBZ
this DT
: :
We PRP
will MD
all DT
fail VB
. .
More JJR
than IN
once RB
. .
Every DT
day NN

I PRP
know VBP
that DT
may MD
sound VB
startling VBG
and CC
not RB
the DT
most RBS
optimistic JJ
of IN
messages NNS
, ,
so RB
let VB
me PRP
be VB
quick JJ
to TO
add VB
that IN
this DT
does VBZ
not RB
mean VB
that IN
you PRP
or CC
I PRP
are VBP
failures NNS
or CC
that IN
the DT
quest NN
for IN
perfection NN
is VBZ
futile JJ

There EX
is VBZ
a DT
difference NN
between IN
failing VBG
, ,
even RB
repeatedly RB
, ,
and CC
being VBG
a DT
failure NN
, ,
as IN
I PRP
hope VBP
to TO
explain VB

Failing NNP
is VBZ
an DT
essential JJ
part NN
of IN
the DT
mortal JJ
phase NN
of IN
our PRP$
quest JJS
for IN
perfection NN

We PRP
don VBP
’ JJ
t NNS
often RB
think VBP
of IN
it PRP
that DT
way NN
, ,
but CC
that DT
is VBZ
only RB
because IN
we PRP
tend VBP
to TO
focus VB
too RB
much JJ
on IN
the DT
word NN
perfection NN
and CC
not RB
enough RB
on IN
the DT
word NN
quest JJS
when WRB
we PRP
read VBD
the DT
mission NN
statement NN
. .
Failure NN
is VBZ
an DT
inevitable JJ
part NN
of IN
the DT
quest JJS
. .
In IN
our PRP$
quest NN
for IN
perfection NN
, ,
how WRB
we PRP
respond VBP
when WRB
we PRP
fail VBP
will MD
ultimately RB
determine VB
how WRB
well RB
we PRP
will MD
succeed VB
. .
My NNP
plea NN
for IN
you PRP
today NN
is VBZ
to TO
learn VB
how WRB
to TO
fail VB
successfully RB
. .
To TO
help VB
you PRP
in IN
that DT

, ,
let VB
me PRP
provide VB
a DT
little JJ
broader JJR
context NN
for IN
the DT
quest JJS
for IN
perfection NN
and CC
the DT
role NN
that IN
failure NN
plays NNS
in IN
that DT
process NN

The DT
primary JJ
purpose NN

our PRP$

to TO

One CD

to TO
accomplish VB
that DT
purpose NN
is VBZ
to TO
learn VB
and CC
apply VB
truth NN
in IN
our PRP$

The DT
Prophet NNP

Smith NNP
taught VBD

“ NN
it PRP

impossible JJ
for IN

” NN

that DT
“ VBZ

no DT
faster JJR

Thus NNP
learning NN

an DT
essential JJ
part NN

not RB
only RB
our PRP$
BYU NNP
experience NN
but CC
also RB
this DT
mortal JJ
phase NN
of IN
our PRP$
quest JJS
for IN

The DT
scriptures NNS

that IN
there EX

three CD
main JJ
ways NNS
we PRP

: :
one CD

4 CD
two CD

three CD

A NNP
lot NN

at IN
BYU NNP
about IN
how WRB

by IN

but CC
we PRP

Yet CC
learning VBG
from IN

is VBZ
one CD
of IN
the DT
essential JJ
purposes NNS
of IN
our PRP$
mortal JJ
existence NN

In IN
the DT
book NN
of IN
Abraham NNP
the DT

we PRP
all DT

the DT
grand JJ

: :

them.8 NN
This DT
earth NN

the DT
setting NN
for IN
our PRP$
mortal JJ
existence NN

was VBD
created VBN
so RB
that IN
we PRP

“ VB

ourselves NNS

But CC
I PRP
believe VBP
we PRP
may MD
not RB
appreciate VB
the DT
full JJ
meaning NN
of IN
the DT
word NN
prove NN
in IN
that DT
scripture NN
. .
In IN
everyday JJ
usage VB
the DT
word NN
prove NN
means VBZ
to TO
demonstrate VB
something NN
that WDT
already RB

Thus NNP
we PRP

final JJ

what WP

we PRP

But CC
the DT
Oxford NNP

provides VBZ
an DT
additional JJ
meaning NN

the DT

prove NN

It PRP

“ JJ

10 CD
I PRP

the DT

one CD

Let VB
me PRP

with IN
a DT
simple JJ
experience NN
from IN

professional JJ
life NN

Two CD
years NNS
after IN

from IN

myself PRP
working VBG

By IN
that DT

I PRP

and CC
had VBD

the DT

In IN
my PRP$
mind NN
I PRP

how WRB

Even RB

not RB

the DT

After IN

confidently RB

The DT

quickly RB

the DT

confidently RB

“ VB

After IN
further JJ
discussing VBG
the DT

with IN
the DT

I PRP
examined VBD
the DT

from IN
several JJ
angles NNS
that WDT

one CD

which WDT

Over IN

a DT

that WDT
changed VBD
the DT

in IN
a DT
subtle JJ

When WRB
I PRP

a DT
more RBR

a DT

The DT

there EX

a DT

just RB

How WRB

that IN

important JJ

The DT

helped VBD

When WRB
I PRP

what WP
it PRP

almost RB
intuit VB
the DT

“ VB

“ NNP

how WRB

” NN
I PRP

“ VB

he PRP

“ NNP

Then RB

a DT

“ NNP

” NN
In IN
other JJ

from IN

As IN

12 CD
We PRP

the DT

when WRB

” VBZ
13 CD
a DT
critical JJ

that IN

Nephi NNP

three CD
main JJ
kinds NNS
of IN

, ,
some DT

which WDT

First RB

there EX

failures NNS
that WDT

from IN
the DT
lack NN

in IN

important JJ
matters—for JJ

, ,
a DT
failure NN
to TO

According VBG

Professor NNP

these DT

“ JJ
bad JJ
” NN
failures NNS
that WDT

preventable JJ
and CC
should MD
be VB
eliminated VBN
as RB
quickly RB
as IN
possible JJ

Second JJ
, ,
there EX
are VBP
failures NNS
that WDT
are VBP
the DT
inevitable JJ
results NNS
of IN
complexity NN
in IN
processes—mistakes NNS
made VBN
in IN
uncontrollable JJ
situations NNS
, ,
such JJ
as IN
in IN

These DT
failures NNS
are VBP
unavoidable JJ
and CC
can MD
not RB
be VB

but CC
they PRP

be VB
managed VBN

Finally RB
, ,
there EX

failures NNS
that WDT

when WRB

the DT
frontiers NNS

made VBN
by IN
a DT

These DT
failures NNS

“ RB

failures NNS

much JJ

In IN
things NNS

In IN

come VB

it PRP

foundation NN
that WDT

When WRB

There EX

both DT

in IN
the DT

and CC
in IN
the DT
coming VBG

? .
Let VB
me PRP
make VB
three CD
simple JJ
suggestions NNS
. .
First NNP
, ,
we PRP
can MD
expand VB
the DT
number NN
of IN
students NNS
who WP
have VBP
a DT
meaningful JJ
experiential JJ
­learning VBG
opportunity NN
. .
We PRP
can MD
, ,
for IN
example NN
, ,
look VB
for IN
ways NNS
to TO
provide VB
more JJR
faculty NN
mentoring NN
opportunities NNS
for IN
them PRP
. .
The DT
impact NN
of IN
faculty NN
mentoring NN
can MD
be VB
enormous JJ
. .
In IN
a DT
report NN
summarizing VBG
a DT
large JJ
number NN
of IN
academic JJ
studies NNS
, ,
clinical JJ
psychologist NN
and CC
professor NN
of IN
psychology NN
W. NNP
Brad NNP
Johnson NNP
said VBD
: :
Compared VBN
to TO
nonmentored JJ
individuals NNS
, ,
those DT
with IN
mentors NNS
tend VBP
to TO
be VB
more RBR
satisfied JJ
with IN
their PRP$
careers NNS
, ,
enjoy RB
more JJR
promotions NNS
and CC
higher JJR
income NN
, ,
report NN
greater JJR
commitment NN
to TO
the DT
organization NN
or CC
profession NN
, ,
and CC
are VBP
more RBR
likely JJ
to TO
mentor VB
others NNS
in IN
turn.18 NN
The DT
impact NN
is VBZ
even RB
greater JJR
at IN
a DT
place NN
like IN
BYU NNP
, ,
where WRB
we PRP
are VBP
interested JJ
in IN
more RBR
than IN
academic JJ
or CC
temporal JJ
success NN
. .
Because IN
we PRP
challenge VBP
faculty JJ
members NNS
to TO
be VB
leaders NNS
in IN
their PRP$
fields NNS
of IN
research NN
and CC
because IN
we PRP
also RB
ask VBP
them PRP
to TO
be VB
faithful JJ
in IN
the DT
gospel NN
, ,
BYU NNP
faculty NN
members NNS
provide VBP
living VBG
examples NNS
of IN
the DT
power NN
of IN
learning NN
by IN
study NN
and CC
by IN
faith NN
. .
Students NNS
can MD
first VB
see VB
, ,
then RB
work NN
with IN
, ,
and CC
eventually RB
emulate JJ
role NN
models NNS
who WP
have VBP
demonstrated VBN
that IN
they PRP
can MD
excel VB
in IN
both DT
their PRP$
fields NNS
and CC
their PRP$
faithfulness NN
. .
Experience NN
of IN
that DT
kind NN
is VBZ
truly RB
inspiring JJ
in IN
both DT
senses NNS
of IN
the DT
word NN
. .
However RB
, ,
there EX
is VBZ
a DT
limit NN
to TO
the DT
number NN
of IN
faculty NN
mentorship NN
opportunities IN
we PRP
can MD
provide VB
. .
As RB
good JJ
as IN
they PRP
are VBP
, ,
our PRP$
faculty NN
have VBP
only RB
twenty-four JJ
hours NNS
in IN
a DT
day NN
, ,
and CC
they PRP
are VBP
already RB
stretched VBN
almost RB
to TO
the DT
limit NN
. .
Fortunately RB
, ,
other JJ
experiential JJ
learning VBG
opportunities NNS
can MD
also RB
promote VB
inspiring VBG
learning VBG
. .
Internships NNP
, ,
study NN
abroad RB
programs NNS
, ,
fieldwork NN
, ,
service NN
learning VBG
opportunities NNS
, ,
and CC
even RB
on-campus JJ
work NN
are VBP
all DT
experiences NNS
that IN
, ,
when WRB
properly RB
structured VBN
, ,
can MD
provide VB
opportunities NNS
to TO
both DT
inspire JJ
students NNS
to TO
learn VB
and CC
help VB
students NNS
learn VB
to TO
be VB
inspired VBN
. .
To TO
increase VB
the DT
number NN
of IN
students NNS
who WP
can MD
have VB
such JJ
experiences NNS
, ,
this DT
year NN
the DT
university NN
provided VBN
substantial JJ
additional JJ
funding NN
to TO
each DT
college NN
, ,
with IN
the DT
central JJ
stipulation NN
that IN
the DT
funds NNS
be VB
directed VBN
to TO
students NNS
to TO
facilitate VB
a DT
structured JJ
experiential JJ
learning NN
opportunity NN
. .
Because IN
the DT
calendar NN
year NN
is VBZ
not RB
yet RB
complete JJ
, ,
it PRP
is VBZ
too RB
early JJ
to TO
measure VB
the DT
overall JJ
impact NN
of IN
this DT
increased VBN
funding NN
in IN
terms NNS
of IN
the DT
number NN
of IN
students NNS
having VBG
such JJ
opportunities NNS
. .
However RB
, ,
anecdotal JJ
reports NNS
from IN
every DT
college NN
indicate VBP
that IN
the DT
funds NNS
have VBP
allowed VBN
numerous JJ
students NNS
to TO
have VB
an DT
experiential JJ
learning NN
opportunity NN
that IN
they PRP
otherwise RB
would MD
have VB
had VBN
to TO
forego VB
for IN
economic JJ
reasons NNS
. .
The DT
results NNS
have VBP
been VBN
encouraging—enough IN
that IN
we PRP
are VBP
working VBG
to TO
provide VB
additional JJ
funding NN
again RB
in IN
2017 CD
and CC
to TO
make VB
securing VBG
even RB
more JJR
funds NNS
one CD
of IN
the DT
top JJ
fund-raising NN
priorities NNS
for IN

Second NNP
, ,
in IN
addition NN
to TO
increasing VBG
the DT
number NN
of IN
opportunities NNS
for IN
inspiring VBG
learning NN
experiences NNS
, ,
we PRP
can MD
work VB
to TO
make VB
the DT

have VBP
even RB
more JJR
impact NN
by IN
being VBG
more JJR
purposeful JJ
and CC
intentional JJ
about IN
what WP
happens VBZ
in IN
those DT
activities NNS

While IN

a DT
life-changing JJ

through IN
careful JJ
and CC
thoughtful JJ

, ,
the DT
impact NN
of IN
the DT

can MD
be VB

severalfold JJ

Similarly RB
, ,
internships NNS
provide VBP
insights NNS
into IN
the DT
skills NNS
required VBN
to TO
succeed VB
in IN
an DT
occupation NN
, ,
but CC

planning NN

that IN
certain JJ
kinds NNS
of IN
activities NNS
occur VBP
and CC
that IN
there EX
is VBZ
adequate JJ
opportunity NN
for IN
reflection NN

I PRP
challenge VBP
all DT
involved VBN
in IN
such JJ
activities NNS
to TO
make VB
sure JJ
we PRP
are VBP
maximizing VBG
the DT
amount NN
of IN
good JJ
that WDT
can MD
result VB
from IN
them PRP

Finally RB
, ,
we PRP
can MD
increase VB
the DT
number NN
of IN
inspiring VBG
learning VBG
moments NNS
for IN
our PRP$
students NNS
if IN
we PRP
recognize VBP
that IN
both DT

are VBP
enhanced VBN
by IN
the DT
quality NN
of IN
the DT
relationships NNS
we PRP
develop VBP
with IN

So RB
what WP

we PRP

the DT
power NN
to TO

in IN

The DT
first JJ
thing NN

No DT

we PRP

How WRB
do VBP
we PRP

that DT

Let VB

a DT
simple JJ
two-step JJ
process NN
: :
We PRP
must MD
first RB
align VB

then RB
we PRP

It PRP

that IN
simple NN

If IN
we PRP

we PRP

So VB
how WRB
do VBP
we PRP

ourselves PRP

God NNP

He PRP
has VBZ
indicated VBN
that IN
the DT
best JJS
way NN
to TO
do VB
that DT

His PRP$
Only JJ

I PRP
think VBP
we PRP
sometimes RB
underestimate VBP
the DT
centrality NN
of IN
covenants NNS
in IN
the DT
gospel NN
plan NN

It PRP
was VBD
only RB
a DT
few JJ
years NNS
ago RB
I PRP
consciously RB
recognized VBD
that IN
the DT
title NN
of IN
our PRP$
scriptural JJ
collection NN
of IN
modern JJ
revelation NN
focuses VBZ
on IN
covenants NNS

We PRP
call VBP
those DT
scriptures NNS
the DT
Doctrine NNP
and CC
Covenants NNP

Maybe NN
it PRP
would MD
be VB
more JJR
clear JJ
if IN
we PRP
referred VBD
to TO
it PRP
as IN
the DT
Doctrine NNP

because IN
those DT
two CD
things NNS
constitute VBP
the DT
focus NN

in IN
this DT

: :
the DT

principles NNS

we PRP

, ,
which WDT
lead VBP
us PRP
to TO
employ VB
and CC
effectuate VB
those DT
truths NNS
in IN
our PRP$
lives NNS

Covenants NNS
are VBP
so RB
powerful JJ
because IN
it PRP
is VBZ
through IN
covenants NNS
that WDT
God NNP
’ NNP

general JJ
promises NNS
are VBP
made VBN
operative JJ
in IN
our PRP$

Elder NNP
Christofferson NNP
explained VBD
it PRP
this DT
way NN
: :
Our PRP$
covenants NNS
supply VBP
strength—they JJ
produce VBP
the DT
faith NN
necessary JJ

all DT
things NNS
that WDT

expedient JJ
in IN

In IN

first JJ
place NN

the DT

fruits NNS

which WDT

our PRP$

Secondly RB

pleasure NN

we PRP
feel VBP

in IN
His PRP$
continued JJ
blessing NN

Thirdly RB
, ,
come VB
what WP
may MD
, ,
we PRP
can MD
face VB
life NN
with IN
hope NN

equanimity NN

knowing VBG
that IN

My NNP
advice NN

Lord NNP
to TO
Emma NNP
Smith NNP
in IN
section NN
25 CD

“ NN
Cleave NNP

” VBD
22 CD
Cleave NNP
does VBZ
not RB
mean VB
to TO
casually RB

lightly RB

It PRP
means VBZ
“ JJ

” $
23 CD
The DT
word NN

Let VB
me PRP

the DT
image NN
of IN

All DT

They PRP
send VBP
out RP
a DT

that WDT

hopefully RB

worst JJS

They PRP
mark VBP
the DT

where WRB
the DT

very RB
important JJ
marker NN
for IN
those DT

Lighthouses NNS

They PRP

constant JJ

therefore VB
rely RB

But CC

another DT
role NN

In IN

lighthouses NNS

In IN

the DT

it PRP

those DT

shore—are NN
in IN

If IN
they PRP

out IN

In IN

October NNP

President NNP

related VBD
an DT

this DT
very RB
well RB

On IN

conference NN
in IN
Western JJ

As IN

the DT

from IN
Savai NNP

Mulifanua NNP

They PRP
had VBD
originally RB
planned VBN

but CC
weather JJR
conditions NNS
prevented VBD
that IN
, ,
so IN
they PRP
set VBP
out RP
on IN
a DT
forty-foot JJ
boat NN

What WP
they PRP
did VBD
not RB
know VB
is VBZ
that IN
they PRP
were VBD
headed VBN
into IN
the DT
center NN
of IN
a DT
ferocious JJ
tropical JJ
storm NN

After IN
many JJ
hours NNS
they PRP
crossed VBD
the DT
rough JJ
seas NNS
and CC
arrived VBN
at IN
the DT
harbor NN
at IN
Mulifanua NNP

President NNP
Packer NNP
explained VBD
what WP
happened VBD
next JJ
: :
We PRP
arrived VBD
in IN
the DT
harbor NN
at IN
Mulifanua NNP

There EX
was VBD
one CD
narrow JJ
passage NN
we PRP
were VBD
to TO
go VB
through IN
along RB
the DT
reef NN

A DT
light NN
on IN
the DT
hill NN
above IN
the DT
beach NN
and CC
a DT
second JJ
lower JJR
light NN
marked VBD
the DT
narrow JJ
passage NN

When WRB
a DT
boat NN
was VBD
maneuvered VBN
so RB
that IN
the DT
two CD
lights NNS
were VBD
one CD
above IN
the DT
other JJ
, ,
the DT
boat NN
would MD
be VB
lined VBN
up RP
properly RB
to TO
pass VB
through IN
the DT
dangerous JJ
rocks NNS
that WDT
lined VBD
the DT
passage NN

But CC
that IN
night NN
there EX
was VBD
only RB
one CD
light NN
. .
Two CD
elders NNS
were VBD
waiting VBG
on IN
the DT
landing NN
to TO
meet VB
us PRP
, ,
but CC
the DT
crossing NN
took VBD
much RB
longer JJR
than IN
usual JJ

After IN
watching VBG
for IN
hours NNS
for IN
signs NNS
of IN
our PRP$

the DT
elders NNS
tired VBD

fell VBD
asleep RB

neglecting VBG

turn VB
on IN
the DT
second JJ

the DT
lower JJR
light NN

As IN
a DT
result NN
, ,
the DT
passage NN
through IN
the DT
reef NN
was VBD
not RB
clear JJ

The DT
captain NN
maneuvered VBD
the DT
boat NN
as IN
best NN
he PRP
could MD
toward IN
the DT
one CD
upper JJ
light NN
on IN
shore NN
while IN
a DT
crewman JJ
held NN
[ VBD
a DT

flashlight NN
over IN

searching VBG

rocks NNS

We PRP
could MD
hear VB
the DT
breakers NNS
crashing VBG
over IN

When WRB
we PRP
were VBD
close RB
enough JJ
to TO
see VB
them PRP
with IN
the DT
flashlight NN
, ,
the DT
captain NN
frantically RB
shouted VBD
reverse NN
and CC
backed VBD
away RB
to TO
try VB
again RB
to TO
locate VB
the DT
passage NN

After IN
many JJ
attempts NNS
, ,
he PRP
knew VBD
it PRP
would MD
be VB
impossible JJ
to TO
find VB
the DT
passage NN
[ NN
without IN
the DT

All DT
we PRP
could MD
do VB
was VBD

to TO
reach VB
the DT

at IN
Apia NNP
40 CD
miles NNS
( (

away RB

We PRP
were VBD
helpless VBN
against IN

ferocious JJ
power NN
of IN

elements.25 NN
The DT
group NN
eventually RB
made VBD
their PRP$
way NN
to TO
safety NN
, ,
but CC
it PRP
was VBD
a DT
harrowing JJ
experience NN

President NNP

observed VBD

“ FW

much RB
to TO
my PRP$
disappointment NN

I PRP

not RB
able JJ

As IN
you PRP

imagine VB
, ,
then RB
, ,
I PRP
was VBD
especially RB
excited JJ
when WRB
I PRP
was VBD
invited VBN
to TO
the DT
exact JJ
same JJ
event NN
the DT
next JJ

and CC
learned VBD
that IN
one CD

Sheri NNP
Dew NNP

This DT
time NN
I PRP
was VBD
able JJ
to TO

I PRP
was VBD
particularly RB
thrilled VBN
when WRB
Sister NNP
Dew NNP
started VBD
off RP
her PRP$
remarks NNS
by IN
saying VBG
that IN
she PRP

going VBG

telling VBG
the DT

she PRP

told VBN
the DT

before—allowing VBG
me PRP

catch VB
up RP

I PRP
was VBD
pleasantly RB
surprised VBN
, ,
thinking VBG
maybe RB
she PRP
was VBD
doing VBG
this DT
just RB
for IN
my PRP$
sake NN

However RB
, ,
she PRP
quickly RB
made VBD
clear JJ
that IN
while IN
she PRP
was VBD
going VBG
to TO
tell VB
the DT
same JJ
story NN
she PRP
had VBD
told VBN
the DT
previous JJ
year NN
, ,
this DT
year NN
she PRP
was VBD
telling VBG
it PRP
to TO
make VB
an DT
entirely RB
different JJ
point NN
from IN
the DT
one CD
she PRP
had VBD
made VBN
the DT
year NN
before RB

Sister NNP
Dew NNP
explained VBD
that IN
she PRP
had VBD
begun VBN
her PRP$
remarks NNS
the DT
prior JJ
year NN
by IN
telling VBG
the DT
women NNS
student NN

how WRB
thrilled JJ
she PRP
was VBD
to TO

invited VBN
to TO
speak VB
because IN
she PRP
had VBD
long RB
wanted VBN
to TO
be VB
a DT
part NN
of IN
BYU NNP
athletics NNS
. .
She PRP
said VBD
something NN
to TO
this DT
effect NN
: :
You PRP
will MD
remember VB
that IN
I PRP
told VBD
you PRP
that IN
when WRB
I PRP
arrived VBD
at IN
BYU NNP
, ,
I PRP
felt VBP
like IN
I PRP
was VBD
the DT
most RBS
ill-prepared JJ
, ,
socially RB
awkward JJ
freshman NN
who WP
had VBD
ever RB
set VBN
foot NN
on IN
this DT
campus NN
. .
I PRP
told VBD
you PRP
then RB
that IN
I PRP
was VBD
from IN
a DT
very RB
small JJ
town NN
in IN
Kansas—a NNP
town NN
much RB
smaller JJR
than IN
the DT
student NN
population NN
of IN
BYU—and NNP
I PRP
felt VBD
completely RB
overwhelmed VBN
, ,
wondering VBG
if IN
I PRP
would MD
ever RB
fit VB
in IN
. .
But CC
there EX
was VBD
one CD
thing NN
I PRP
thought VBD
might MD
provide VB
an DT
entry NN
into IN
the DT
BYU NNP
community NN
, ,
and CC
that DT
was VBD
basketball NN

I PRP
had VBD
played VBN
basketball NN
in IN
high JJ
school NN
in IN
Kansas NNP
, ,
and CC
, ,
quite RB
frankly RB
, ,
I PRP
thought VBD
I PRP
was VBD
pretty RB
good JJ

So IN
I PRP
decided VBD
I PRP
would MD
try VB
out RP
for IN
the DT
women NNS
’ VBP
s JJ
basketball NN
team NN
. .
I PRP
learned VBD
all DT
I PRP
could MD
about IN
the DT
team NN
: :
who WP
the DT
coach NN
was VBD
, ,
who WP
had VBD
left VBN
the DT
team NN
, ,
who WP
was VBD
returning VBG
, ,
and CC
when WRB
the DT
tryouts NNS
were VBD
to TO
be VB
held VBN
. .
Sister NNP
Dew NNP
then RB
said VBD
: :
You PRP
will MD
recall VB
that IN
I PRP
told VBD
you PRP
last JJ
year NN
how WRB
I PRP
summoned VBD
up RP
all DT
my PRP$
courage NN
and CC
went VBD
to TO
the DT
appointed VBN
gym NN
in IN
the DT
Richards NNP
Building NNP
where WRB
tryouts NNS
were VBD
to TO
be VB

Wanting VBG
to TO
make VB
sure JJ
I PRP
maximized VBD
my PRP$
chances NNS
, ,
I PRP
had VBD
arrived VBN
early RB
. .
You PRP
will MD
also RB
remember VB
how WRB
I PRP
told VBD
you PRP
that IN
I PRP
opened VBD
the DT
door NN
to TO
the DT
gym NN
with IN
some DT
confidence NN
, ,
and CC
then RB
I PRP
watched VBD
the DT
girls NNS
who WP
were VBD
playing VBG
there RB
. .
I PRP
thought VBD
to TO
myself VB
, ,
“ NNP
Wow NNP
, ,
they PRP
are VBP
really RB
good. JJ
” NN
You PRP
will MD
remember VB
how WRB
I PRP
told VBD
you PRP
that IN
I PRP
closed VBD
the DT
door NN
and CC
then RB
spent VBD
the DT
next JJ
three CD
hours NNS
walking VBG
up RB
and CC
down IN
the DT
hallways NNS
of IN
the DT
Richards NNP
Building NNP
trying VBG
to TO
muster VB
up RP
enough RB
courage NN
to TO
go VB
back RB
for IN
the DT
tryouts NNS
but CC
that IN
I PRP
finally RB
gave VBD
up RP
and CC
returned VBN
to TO
my PRP$
dorm NN
room NN
without IN
making VBG
the DT
effort NN
to TO
try VB
out RP
. .
I PRP
told VBD
you PRP
that IN
story NN
last JJ
year NN
so RB
that IN
you PRP
would MD
understand VB
that IN
I PRP
truly VBP
meant JJ
it PRP
when WRB
I PRP
told VBD
you PRP
that IN
I PRP
was VBD
thrilled VBN
more JJR
than IN
you PRP
knew VBP
that IN
I PRP
had VBD
been VBN
asked VBN
to TO

to TO
the DT

student NN
athletes NNS
at IN
BYU NNP
and CC
to TO
be VB
made VBN
an DT
honorary JJ
member NN
of IN
that DT

I PRP
wanted VBD
you PRP
to TO
know VB
that IN
it PRP
really RB
was VBD
the DT
fulfillment NN
of IN
a DT
lifelong JJ
dream NN

But CC
I PRP
am VBP
telling VBG
you PRP
this DT
same JJ
story NN
this DT

for IN
a DT
much JJ
different JJ
purpose NN
because IN
of IN
what WP
happened VBD
immediately RB
after IN
I PRP

last JJ

After IN
I PRP
had VBD
spoken VBN
last JJ

, ,
Sister NNP
Elaine NNP
Michaelis NNP
came VBD
up RB
to TO
me PRP

Now RB

Sister NNP

She PRP

Now RB

with IN

let VB
me PRP

what WP
Sister NNP

went VBD
on IN
to TO
say VB
: :
Sister NN
Michaelis NNP

after IN

last JJ

she PRP

while IN

still RB
on IN

Sister NNP
Michaelis NNP
asked VBD

“ ''

“ NN
Of IN

“ FW

Then RB

Sister NNP

It PRP

There EX

God NNP

If IN

I PRP

You PRP

We PRP

Grand NNP

our PRP$
Father NN

described VBD
His PRP$
plan NN

Critical NNP
to TO
that DT

was VBD
the DT
role NN

who WP

live VB

thereby RB
allowing VBG

that WDT

we PRP

But CC
there EX
was VBD
also RB
another DT
plan NN

one CD
put VBD
forth NN
by IN
Lucifer NNP

A NNP
war NN
was VBD
waged VBN
between IN

of IN
these DT
two CD

As IN
recorded VBN
in IN

we PRP

on IN

It PRP

not RB
a DT

a DT

a DT
war NN
of IN
concepts—a JJ
war NN
in IN
which WDT

our PRP$
main JJ

Listen VB

how WRB

as IN

in IN
Revelation NNP
12 CD
: :
And CC
there EX

Michael NNP

It PRP

the DT

It PRP

At IN

the DT
Atonement NNP

All DT

the DT

our PRP$
Heavenly NNP
Father NNP

Christ NNP
that IN

perform VB
His PRP$

It PRP
all DT

And CC
we PRP

the DT

of IN
whether IN

in IN
those DT
circumstances NNS

All DT
we PRP

our PRP$

But CC
in IN
that DT
critical JJ
time NN

we PRP
all DT
chose VBD
to TO
be VB
governed VBN
by IN
faith NN

not RB
by IN

If IN
we PRP
sometimes VBP

whether IN

act VB
on IN
that DT

when WRB
it PRP
most JJS

we PRP

emboldened VBN
by IN
the DT

In IN

3 CD
A NNP
quick JJ
review NN
of IN
the DT
mission NN
statement NN
makes VBZ
two CD
things NNS
very RB
clear JJ
: :
First RB
, ,
our PRP$
primary JJ
focus NN
is VBZ
on IN
teaching VBG
­students NNS
. .
That DT
may MD
seem VB
obvious JJ
. .
You PRP
may MD
think VB
that IN
every DT
university NN
focuses VBZ
on IN
teaching VBG
students NNS
; :
that DT
is VBZ
why WRB
they PRP
exist VBP
. .
That DT
is VBZ
true JJ
. .
But CC
at IN
many JJ
universities NNS
the DT
size NN
of IN
BYU NNP
, ,
the DT
focus NN
on IN
teaching VBG
students NNS
is VBZ
counterbalanced VBN
against IN
an DT
emphasis NN
on IN
faculty NN
research NN
, ,
with IN
students NNS
sometimes RB
relegated VBD
to TO
coequal VB
or CC
even RB
secondary JJ
status NN
in IN
some DT
decisions NNS
. .
While IN
research NN
is VBZ
an DT
important JJ
part NN
of IN
what WP
happens VBZ
at IN
BYU NNP
, ,
various JJ
features NNS
of IN
the DT
mission NN
statement NN
remind VB
us PRP
that IN
students NNS
must MD
remain VB
the DT
central JJ
priority NN
. .
For IN
example NN
, ,
the DT
word NN
students NNS
appears VBZ
in IN
the DT
mission NN
statement NN
seven CD
times NNS
. .
The DT
word NN
faculty NN
appears VBZ
twice RB
. .
The DT
word NN
administrators VBZ
appears VBZ
only RB
once RB
. .
Although IN
I PRP
am VBP
quite RB
confident JJ
that IN
the DT
authors NNS
of IN
the DT
mission NN
statement NN
did VBD
not RB
engage VB
in IN
a DT
careful JJ
word NN
count NN
to TO
ensure VB
that IN
the DT
relative JJ
importance NN
of IN
each DT
group NN
was VBD
precisely RB
represented VBN
in IN
the DT
numeric JJ
ratio NN
, ,
the DT
relative JJ
use NN
of IN
each DT
term NN
serves VBZ
as IN
a DT
reminder NN
that IN
our PRP$
mission NN
focuses VBZ
on IN
the DT
­students—and NNP
not RB
on IN
the DT
faculty NN
or CC
anyone NN
else RB
. .
Second NNP
, ,
consistent NN
with IN
the DT
emphasis NN
on IN
students NNS
, ,
the DT
vast JJ
majority NN
of IN
the DT
mission NN
statement NN
focuses VBZ
primarily RB
on IN
undergraduates NNS
and CC
what WP
they PRP
should MD
learn VB
. .
The DT
description NN
of IN
the DT
type NN
of IN
education NN
students NNS
are VBP
to TO
receive VB
is VBZ
geared VBN
primarily RB
to TO
undergraduates NNS

According VBG
to TO
the DT
mission NN
statement NN
, ,
students NNS
are VBP
to TO
receive VB
a DT
broad JJ
general JJ
education NN
with IN
in-depth JJ
learning NN
and CC
instruction NN
in IN
a DT
selected JJ
major JJ
field.4 NN
In IN
other JJ
words NNS
, ,
they PRP
are VBP
to TO
receive VB
a DT
traditional JJ
liberal JJ
arts NNS
and CC
sciences NNS
undergraduate JJ
education NN
. .
Our PRP$
enrollment JJ
numbers NNS
reflect VBP
that IN
same JJ
undergraduate JJ
focus NN
. .
We PRP
have VBP
approximately RB
33,000 CD
full-time JJ
students NNS
, ,
of IN
which WDT
30,000 CD
are VBP
undergraduates NNS
; :
only RB
3,000 CD
are VBP
graduate JJ
students NNS

At IN
many JJ
major JJ
universities NNS
the DT
balance NN
is VBZ
much RB
closer JJR
to TO
50/50 CD
or CC
in IN
some DT
cases NNS
is VBZ
even RB
weighted VBN
more JJR
heavily RB
in IN
favor NN
of IN
graduate NN
students NNS

Thus VB
the DT
mission NN
statement NN
makes VBZ
clear JJ
that IN
BYU NNP
is VBZ
primarily RB
an DT
undergraduate JJ
teaching NN
institution NN
, ,
not RB

The DT
only JJ
reference NN

encouraged VBN
among IN
both DT

the DT

Today NN

I PRP

few JJ
, ,
if IN
any DT

quibble JJ
about IN
whether IN

belong VBP
at IN

One CD
reason NN
the DT

ended VBN
is VBZ
that IN
, ,
over IN
time NN
, ,
law NN
schools NNS
became VBD
profit NN
centers NNS
for IN
their PRP$
universities NNS

Because IN
the DT
faculty-student JJ
ratio NN
in IN
law NN
school NN
is VBZ
so RB
much JJ
higher JJR
than IN
that DT
of IN
most JJS
graduate JJ
programs NNS
and CC
because IN
legal JJ
research NN
does VBZ
not RB
require VB
expensive JJ
labs NN

, ,
law NN
schools NNS
cost VBP
much RB
less JJR
per IN
student NN
than IN
most JJS
graduate JJ
programs NNS
, ,
and CC
they PRP
typically RB
produce VBP
excess JJ
revenues NNS
that IN
they PRP
share NN
with IN
the DT
university NN
. .
It PRP
is VBZ
easy JJ
to TO
welcome VB
as IN
a DT
member NN
of IN
the DT
university NN
a DT
program NN
that WDT
regularly RB
generates VBZ
revenue NN
for IN
the DT
university NN

By IN
that DT
monetary JJ
measure NN
, ,
law NN
schools NNS
have VBP
generally RB
been VBN
“ NNP
of IN

” NN
to TO
their PRP$

for IN
quite RB
some DT

However RB
, ,
the DT
recent JJ
dramatic JJ
decline NN
in IN
law NN
school NN
applications NNS
may MD
alter VB
the DT
way NN
universities NNS
think VBP
about IN
their PRP$

As IN
enrollments NNS

therefore RB
revenues NNS

decrease NN
, ,
some DT
universities NNS
now RB
find VBP
themselves PRP
in IN
the DT
position NN
of IN

their PRP$

My PRP$
guess NN
is VBZ
that IN
the DT

in IN
quite RB
a DT

Key NNP

three CD

which WDT
I PRP

The DT
latter JJ
two CD
reasons NNS

In IN

both DT

less JJR

Fortunately RB

neither DT

I PRP

not RB
just RB

this DT
unusual JJ

that IN

That DT
is VBZ
admittedly RB
a DT
very RB
ambitious JJ

audacious—and VB
some DT
would MD
say VB
unrealistic—aspiration NN

But CC
I PRP

better RBR

this—that IN

The DT

a DT
key NN
for IN
how WRB

this DT
lofty JJ

The DT
theme NN
comes VBZ
from IN

“ NN

That WDT

both DT
an DT

a DT

Both DT

especially RB
relevant JJ
in IN
the DT
COVID NNP
world NN
in IN

The DT
admonition NN
is VBZ
very RB
simple JJ
: :
“ NN
Be NNP
not RB
weary JJ

” NN
That IN
advice NN
seems VBZ
tailored VBN
specifically RB
to TO
the DT
situation NN
in IN

It PRP

so RB
easy JJ

everything NN

The DT
term NN
“ NNP

But CC
surely RB
one CD

the DT
principal JJ

the DT
seemingly RB
ubiquitous JJ
uncertainty NN
that WDT

It PRP

difficult—and JJ

carefully RB

it PRP

That DT

what WP
we PRP

day-to-day JJ

it PRP

clearly RB

what WP

It PRP

hard JJ

because RB

much JJ
uncertainty NN

misinformation NN
that WDT

And CC
this DT

where WRB
the DT

The DT
Lord NNP

Similarly RB
, ,
given VBN
its PRP$
origins NNS

I PRP
suppose VBP
some DT

view VB
the DT

However RB

I—and NNP
I PRP

most JJS

and CC
that IN

If IN

greater JJR
strength NN
to TO
meet VB
the DT

that WDT

inevitably RB

All PDT
that DT
depends VBZ
on IN
how WRB
we PRP

Even RB
with IN
that DT
more RBR

there EX
will MD
be VB
times NNS
when WRB
you PRP

when WRB
despite IN

you PRP

fall VB

of IN

when WRB
you PRP

feel VB
that IN

like IN

have VB
felt VBN
when WRB

But CC
, ,
as IN

the DT

even RB

at IN

You PRP

It PRP

( (

A NNP

You PRP

Each DT

Thus NNP
you PRP

even RB
that DT

The DT
highest JJS
level NN
of IN

according VBG
to TO
scholars NNS

is VBZ
what WP
Seligman NNP
referred VBD

which WDT

a DT

fulfilling VBG

When WRB

the DT

on.7 IN
The DT

As IN

11 CD
So IN
we PRP
begin VBP
by IN
asking VBG

“ VB
What WP
is VBZ

” NN
That DT
is VBZ
not RB
a DT
simple JJ

It PRP

a DT

that DT
language NN
is VBZ
a DT
little JJ
imprecise NN

ultimately RB
inadequate JJ

For IN

some DT

although IN
in IN

this DT
much RB

not RB
merely RB
a DT
temporary JJ

rather RB
a DT
more RBR
permanent JJ

As IN

“ PDT

It PRP

Cultivating VBG

in IN
Our PRP$

First NNP
, ,
we PRP
need VBP

constantly RB

that IN
our PRP$
ability NN

in IN
this DT

in IN

not RB
dependent JJ
on IN

As IN
President NNP

eloquently RB
put VBD
it PRP
: :
The DT

When WRB

This DT

the DT

It PRP

contrary JJ
to TO
what WP

This DT

It PRP

President NNP

this DT

even RB

Second JJ

we PRP

uninterrupted JJ

a DT

Suffering VBG

a DT

of IN
the DT

by IN

it PRP

Essential JJ

I PRP

the DT
premise NN
that IN
the DT

endeavor NN
in IN
which WDT

engaged VBN
is VBZ
greatly RB
enhanced VBN
by IN
our PRP$
gathering VBG
together RB
in IN
one CD
particular JJ
place NN

This DT
thought VBD
first RB
came VBD
to TO
me PRP
when WRB
I PRP
became VBD
the DT
dean NN
of IN
the DT
law NN
school NN
here RB
at IN
BYU NNP

It PRP
was VBD
then RB
that IN
I PRP
began VBD

the DT
enormous JJ
resources NNS
the DT

to TO
bring VB
us PRP
all DT

on IN

for IN
the DT
purpose NN
of IN

experience NN
to TO

As IN
I PRP
considered VBD
the DT
amount NN
of IN

that IN
the DT

provided VBD
to TO
the DT
law NN
school—not VBZ
only RB
for IN

expenses NNS
but CC
for IN
capital JJ
projects NNS
as IN
well—I NN
concluded VBD
that IN
if IN
all PDT
the DT
Church NNP
wanted VBD
to TO
accomplish VB
was VBD
to TO
ensure VB
that IN
120 CD
active JJ

covenant-keeping JJ
Latter-day JJ
Saints NNS
could MD
obtain VB
a DT
good JJ
legal JJ
education NN
each DT

without IN
incurring VBG
unnecessary JJ
debt NN
, ,
the DT

might MD
be VB
better JJR
off RP
financially RB

simply RB
give VB
a DT
very RB
generous JJ
stipend NN
to TO
each DT
of IN
those DT

students NNS

send VB
them PRP
off RP

really RB
good JJ
law NN
schools NNS

But CC
that DT
is VBZ
not RB
what WP
Church NNP
leaders NNS
chose VBD
to TO
do VB
. .
Instead RB
, ,
at IN
great JJ
expense NN
, ,
they PRP
built VBP
, ,
staffed NN
, ,
and CC
maintained VBD
a DT
law NN
school NN
where WRB
these DT
students NNS
could MD
gather VB
together RB
. .
Reflecting VBG
on IN
this DT
decision NN
, ,
I PRP
determined VBD
that IN
there EX
must MD
be VB
something NN
more JJR
that IN
comes VBZ
out IN
of IN

BYU NNP

experience NN
than IN
the DT

the DT

students NNS
who WP
might MD
as IN

better RBR

As IN
I PRP
now RB
consider VBP
the DT
budget NN

the DT
hundreds NNS
of IN

it PRP

, ,
I PRP
have VBP
come VBN
to TO
the DT
same JJ
conclusion NN
with IN
respect NN
to TO
the DT
entire JJ
university NN
. .
There EX
must MD
be VB
some DT
reason NN
other JJ
than IN
providing VBG
an DT
affordable JJ
education NN
to TO
30,000 CD
students NNS
that WDT
would MD
cause VB
Church NNP

to TO
expend VB
all PDT

all PDT
the DT

and CC
managing VBG
its PRP$
operations NNS
in IN
order NN
to TO
bring VB
people—specifically RB
, ,
you PRP
­students—here RB
. .
As IN
I PRP
have VBP
begun VBN
to TO
understand VB
the DT
doctrine NN
of IN
gathering NN
, ,
the DT
why WRB
has VBZ
become VBN
a DT
little JJ
more JJR
clear JJ
. .
The DT
concept NN
of IN
gathering NN
goes VBZ
back RB
much JJ
further RBR
in IN
time NN
than IN
many JJ
realize NN
. .
It PRP
seems VBZ
to TO
have VB
been VBN
part NN
of IN
the DT
plan NN
before IN
the DT
earth NN
was VBD
even RB
created VBN
. .
The DT
Prophet NNP
Joseph NNP
Smith NNP
taught NN
: :
It PRP
was VBD
the DT
design NN
of IN
the DT
councils NNS
of IN
heaven NN
before IN
the DT
world NN
was VBD
, ,
that IN
the DT
principles NNS
and CC
laws NNS
of IN
the DT
priesthood NN
should MD
be VB
predicated VBN
upon IN
the DT
gathering NN
of IN
the DT
people NNS
in IN
every DT
age NN
of IN
the DT
world.5 NN
It PRP
is VBZ
not RB
surprising JJ
then RB
that IN
even RB
before IN
Israel NNP
was VBD
scattered VBN
throughout IN
the DT
earth—indeed NN
, ,
even RB
before IN
there EX
was VBD
a DT
group NN
of IN
people NNS
called VBN
Israelites—Adam NNP
physically RB
gathered VBD
his PRP$
posterity NN
together RB
in IN
the DT
valley NN
of IN
Adam-ondi-Ahman.6 NNP
And CC
one CD
of IN
the DT
reasons NNS
he PRP
did VBD
so RB
was VBD
to TO
provide VB
instruction NN
to TO
those DT
whom WP
he PRP
had VBD
physically RB
gathered VBN
together.7 NN
Thus NNP
, ,
from IN
the DT
outset NN
, ,
education NN
has VBZ
been VBN
one CD
of IN
the DT
main JJ
purposes NNS
of IN
gathering NN
. .
In IN
fact NN
, ,
education NN
of IN
the DT
most RBS
important JJ
type NN
seems VBZ
to TO
require VB
a DT
physical JJ

Joseph NNP
Smith NNP

: :

Joseph NNP
seemed VBD
to TO
indicate VB
that IN
there EX
is VBZ
something NN
about RB
physical JJ
proximity—about NN
gathering NN
in IN

is VBZ
essential JJ
to TO

, ,
at IN

to TO
the DT
kind NN
of IN

that WDT

In IN

at IN
one CD

in IN

wonder VB
if IN

merely RB

only RB

President NNP

If IN

which WDT

charity NN

Thus NNP
we PRP

only RB

a DT

The DT
difficulty NN

that RB

Only RB

Moreover RB

the DT

constant JJ

Self-inspection NN

With IN

John NNP

: :
In IN

I PRP

out IN

Intuitively RB

I PRP

I PRP

My PRP$

But CC
I PRP

That DT

the DT

The DT

the DT

I PRP

John NNP

But CC
he PRP
did VBD
not RB

his PRP$

As IN
he PRP
put VBD
it PRP
: :
One CD

” VB
After IN

John NNP

As IN

The DT

“ IN

Through IN

America NNP

Now RB

Our PRP$

The DT

I PRP

We PRP

Every DT

every DT

through IN

America NNP

at IN

A NNP

Some DT

in IN

the DT

If IN

If IN

we PRP

If IN

the DT

We PRP

Civility NNP
is VBZ
not RB
a DT

It PRP

the DT

And CC
this DT

America NNP

Our PRP$

Now RB
